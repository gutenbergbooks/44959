<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Les vrais evènemens de la Vie sont quelquefois, beaucoup
plus incroyable que ceux que l'Imagination presente à l'Esprit."</p>

<p class= "p2">
<span class="smcap">L'Abbe Prevôt.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>There are some whose lot it is to pace the
dull and beaten round of daily life like a sort
of moral turn-spit, unconscious of the stages by
which they travel from the cradle to the tomb.
To these the extraordinary accidents and romantic
coincidences, which occasionally chequer
and diversify the flat road of human existence
in the history of other men, appear incredible
as the Arabian Nights' Entertainment; yet Fiction,
in her most fantastic mood, does not leave
the common average of events farther behind
than reality is continually doing. Zorilda's was
no common fate, and it pursued her to the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Rachel's schemes had prospered so entirely
that, by the time that she and her young mistress
reached the great northern line, no farther
anxiety attended their progress, and they journied
onwards without apprehension. They
stopped in the first large town, and found no
difficulty in procuring pecuniary supplies at the
Bank. So far all proceeded smoothly; but the
pale cheek, and smileless eye, bore witness to
that grief which "doth not speak" but "whispers
the o'erfraught heart and bids it break."</p>

<p>There is sorrow which lies too deep for the
landscape or the breeze. Neither air nor scene
can reach its dwelling; and the change of both,
which proves a sovereign balm to light afflictions,
brought no healing to Zorilda's heart. It
had not been always thus. There was a time
when her glad eye hailed the rising sun with
answering ray; and her young spirit, all alive
to the charms of undefined but sparkling anticipation,
which dresses the future in bright ideal
glories, could carol with the lark at early dawn.
Alive, with more than common enthusiasm, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the beauties of nature, every opening bud and
blossom had once inspired joy; but the charm
was broken, sunshine and spring only seemed
now to mock her grief, while one exclusive torturing
thought occupied every avenue of sense.
Algernon was false&mdash;Algernon was unworthy&mdash;and
the affection which could no longer flow in
unresisted tide towards him, returned with all
the overwhelming force of a back-water current
into her bosom.</p>

<p>It is maintained by some writers that woman's
love ought to cling blindly to its object, and survive
every trial. A true and devoted attachment
is indeed proof against every attack which
can assail it from without. The female breast
can endure the rudest shocks of adversity, and
outlive the severest reverses of fortune&mdash;it can
preserve its bloom within the walls of a prison,
and its warmth amid Siberian snows&mdash;but it is
a vulgar love which grasps at the empty casket,
after the gem which it contained is thrown away.
Zorilda's soul was incapable of harbouring any
but pure and exalted sentiments, which when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
driven from the cherished object on whom they
rested, came back with oppressive weight upon
her widowed breast.</p>

<p>After a day's journey, which had been rendered
particularly fatiguing from bad horses,
our travellers reached the town of&mdash;&mdash;. They
arrived late, and found that every room at the
inn was occupied. There was no second, and
upon inquiring for private lodgings, the landlady
of the Greyhound assured them that it was
quite vain to hope for a bed any where. Young
Squire Macdonald had just come of age. He
was eldest son to Sir Herbert, and heir to immense
estates. The great house was undergoing
repairs, and therefore a splendid ball, which it
was impossible to give on the present joyful occasion
at the family mansion, was to assemble
all the surrounding gentry that night at the
inn. The company was to be as numerous as
possible, to secure popularity, and, "in fact,"
the landlady added, with a broad grin, "our
powers of accommodation are the only limits to
Sir Herbert's hospitality on this happy event."</p>

<p>What was to be done? Nothing in nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
could be less accordant with the feelings of Zorilda
than the sound of mirth and revelry; but
the night was dark, and she feared to proceed
any farther. The next stage too was long, and
lay over a dreary moor. The landlady also protested
that she had not a horse in the stables
which was not nearly "jaded to death."</p>

<p>"Only allow me to remain under the protection
of your roof," said Zorilda, "I shall not
require any care or attendance." "I am sure,"
replied the landlady, "I never was so puzzled
in all my life. If it was my sister, I could
neither promise her a bed or a mutton chop.
Even now, while I stand talking, I assure you,
Ma'am, that I am wanted in half a dozen different
places."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," answered Zorilda; "but
I can do without a bed and mutton chop. Only
take me in. Put me any where, but <i>pray</i> do
not refuse me."</p>

<p>The landlady was mollified, and promised to
do her best, but gave fair warning that that <i>best</i>
would prove a sorry sort of welcome to weary
travellers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Zorilda drew her veil closely over her face, and
wrapping Rachel's large cloak round her person
descended from the carriage, and following the
woman of the house through a long stone entry
and up a wide stair-case, which were lighted up
and decorated with laurel branches, was ushered
into a miserable scrap of an apartment, if indeed
such a cage might be dignified with the style of
one. There was neither table nor chair in it,
but both were to be brought in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Here, Ma'am, is the only cranny that I have
to offer you, and I am very sorry for it," said
the landlady. "I should not have even this to
give you but for an accident to one of our gutters,
and you see this wall is ruined by the deluge
of water that came down upon it. I sent
to London for paper, which did not come in
time, so here you perceive I have been obliged
to knock up a few boards, in the greatest hurry
you can imagine, into a sort of partition, which
I have hung all over with drapery, on the other
side, to hide the new timber. There are only
a few gentlemen in the house, who are sitting
at their wine below stairs; and before the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
assembles you could just step here into the
ball-room, and I think you will say that it is
well contrived and tasty."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you," answered Zorilda,
"and am sure that all your arrangements are
made in the best manner, but I will take possession
of my quarters, and only wish that they
were farther removed from the gay revels which
are soon to begin. This is a thin partition, I
hope at least that it is secure.</p>

<p>"Oh! bless you, yes, Ma'am. You will see
nothing of the company. I wish I could guard
you as well from hearing them," answered the
landlady, whose houshold cares now "called her
hence;" and who added, as she tripped out of
the room, "you will have little quiet or comfort,
but you can lock your door on the inside, and
when the hurry of supper is over, if I can, I
will get you a mattress."</p>

<p>Zorilda cared little about want of comfort,
but she wished herself far from the riotous
scene in which the sense of hearing, if not of
sight, was soon to be involved.</p>

<p>Rachel exerted herself to do as much for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
mistress' accommodation, as the case would
admit. A small table and an arm-chair were
provided, and "now, my dear child," said the
kind hearted creature, "that I have at last seen
you fairly seated, I will go and see if I cannot
fetch you a cup of hot coffee, and a nice dry
toast." Carriages arrived, and the company
poured in like a torrent. A band of music
began to play. Zorilda had never heard so full
a harmony of instruments since she left her
native country, and the effect was magical.
The musicians gave a popular Spanish air, to
which, when an infant of three years old, she
had often danced with a little pair of castanets.
The stores of memory seemed suddenly unlocked.
Her nurse, her cottage, the grove of
chestnuts, the kind visitor whom she called her
father, all were pictured in her mind's eye with
the most vivid colouring, and as if called by
fairy wand from a world of shadows to live again
on earth.</p>

<p>"Oh! why cannot I remember thee, beloved
mother," she exclaimed, as opening her precious
packet which lay folded in her bosom, she pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the lovely image to her breast; "but no sound
of melody can, with mysterious power, strike
upon that chord, and draw forth strains of
'linked sweetness.' I was too young when torn
from this snowy pillow, to see, to feel the heavenly
mildness of that eye, the tender pathos
of that smile."</p>

<p>The rooms filled, and all the "laughter loving
Gods" were busy in producing such a din,
that Zorilda's head ached from an uproar so uncongenial
with her spirits.</p>

<p>"Can this be pleasure?" said she, as she
listened to the vapid jest, the unmeaning laugh,
the idle listless talk, which, penetrating the thin
screen that separated her from the throng, came
upon her unwilling ear. "Yes, these are the
joys of which Algernon used to tell me, and
joys perhaps they might have seemed, if tasted
in his society; but I resemble the blind who
live <i>within</i>, and imagination, which is most
active when things external are shut out, weaves
her web of 'sweet and bitter fancies,' which are
little accordant with the world's opinions."</p>

<p>Rachel returned, but desirous to pursue her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
thoughts in solitude, Zorilda sent her to amuse
herself with staring at all the fine dresses and
equipages, which formed in her estimation, the
most magnificent spectacle she had ever looked
upon; and much did she wish if possible, to
inspire her young mistress with a single spark
of her own curiosity to witness so splendid a
pageant.</p>

<p>Once more alone in her cell, Zorilda endeavoured
to abstract her mind from the noisy
scene. She took out her mother's diamond
cross, and having kissed, she pinned it to her
breast.</p>

<p>"I will wear you always," said she, "next
my heart, but it shall be unseen. When I
reach Drumcairn, I will have a ribband and
suspend it round my neck. This bracelet, too.
These are <i>my</i> jewels, and they are gems of more
worth than Potosi's mines could furnish, or Golconda
has ever sent forth."</p>

<p>She had laid aside her cloak and veil. Her
beautiful hair, which was only restrained by a
tortoise-shell comb from falling over her shoulders,
curled in rich profusion over her ivory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
throat and forehead. The air of evening had
fanned a rose-bud tint upon her cheek, and a
black silk dress which folded across the bosom,
formed the simple costume of her, whom only
the thickness of a half-inch board concealed from
that mirthful multitude, over whom in mingling,
she would have reigned queen paramount, in
loveliness and grace.</p>

<p>Amongst the papers which lay before her, was
the letter which she had picked up in the walk
at Henbury, when she had been startled by a
rustling in the bushes behind where she sat.
The idea struck her as she now looked over it
again, with relation to other parts of her history
since developed, that a father's care might
watch at distance over her destiny. He was an
English nobleman, perhaps, nay probably, a
married man, and withheld not only by a sense
of the wrongs which he had inflicted, but, also
by existing family interests, from revealing himself
to his injured child. This conjecture was
little soothing; on the contrary, a cold tremor
ran through her frame at thoughts of him who
basely deceived, and then deserted those to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
whom he was bound by the most powerful ties
of nature as well as moral obligation.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said she, "as my father, whoever,
or wherever he may be, I owe him reverence;
but may I be spared the necessity of paying a
tribute which could never be animated by affection!
Better remain the unknown, despised
'Who is she?' than obtain a name and place
in society at the cost of incurring Heaven's
displeasure by violating the first of earthly
duties."</p>

<p>As she uttered these words within her heart,
her eyes were raised upwards, and her hands
clasped in a posture of supplication.</p>

<p>At this instant a heavy crash, as if one of the
dancers had fallen with great force against the
weak partition, levelled the frail screen, which
went to pieces, and came in fragments to the
ground.</p>

<p>What a scene was now unveiled! Zorilda
narrowly escaped receiving on her head a piece
of the timber, which laid the table at which she
had been sitting prostrate at her feet, and together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with it, the now scattered contents of her
sacred packet.</p>

<p>The male part of the assembly rushed simultaneously
forward to offer assistance, while, terrified
and amazed, our heroine started from her
seat, the most beautiful object that had ever
graced a ball-room, revealing too</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"the sparkling cross she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which saints might kiss, and infidels adore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One gathered up the loose sheets of the narrative;
another found the bracelets; and a third,
who had seized the miniature, glancing at it before
he presented it to the owner, uttered an involuntary
ejaculation, and stood like one transfixed;
but instantaneously recovering his presence
of mind, he advanced, and grasping the
hand which was extended to receive the portrait,
with frenzied fervour, restored the <i>treasure trove</i>,
and darted out of the room. The words which
he had spoken, though probably not caught by
others in the confusion of the moment, reached
Zorilda's ear, for her eyes were intently fixed on
him whom she saw take up her picture from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
floor; and the exclamation, "Oh! my daughter!"
reverberating through every nerve, she
felt her knees refuse their office, and tottering
backwards, she fell into the arm-chair, almost
bereft of sense; yet dreading the effect of her
emotion, and fearful of losing again any part of
what she prized more than life itself, she seemed
suddenly invigorated, and hastily folding her
packet once more to her bosom, she waved her
head gracefully in acknowledgment of gratitude
for polite attention, and pressed towards the
door, which was opened for her by one of the
many who were only anxious to try who should
be foremost in affording aid. Numberless arms
were proffered to support her, but declined, and
with such an air of sincerity, as forbade all farther
solicitations.</p>

<p>The waiters who had heard the crash, came
running from all parts of the house, and Rachel
was not wanting in the train, who flew to inquire
what had happened. Zorilda seized her
arm, and desired to be shown immediately to
the landlady's apartment. Thither she was conveyed,
quite exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must leave this place," said she, "before
the dawn of day. Offer any thing as a bribe for
fresh horses, but procure me the means of quitting
this inn before the company break up; here
I cannot stay, and the repose which this dreadful
uproar denies, may be found at no great distance.
I am not well, and my brain will become
disordered if I cannot find quiet. Dear Rachel
use your best diligence."</p>

<p>Rachel left the room; and as there are few
things which money cannot procure, an offer of
double fare soon produced the promise of as fine
a pair of horses as ever ran in harness, which it
was now <i>recollected</i> could be had at break of
day. Ere long, she returned with the news, and
with a story to boot.</p>

<p>"Lord o' mercy, my dear, but I have had
my own share of trouble since I left you here,
less than half an hour ago. There is all the
whole town, I believe, in a ferment about
you. 'Who is she? Who is she?' says one:
'Who is she? Where does she come from?
Where is she going?' says another. I thought
they would tear me to pieces among them. 'Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
she a foreigner? Spanish, French, or Italian?'
Now all along we forgot to settle what name
you should bear, and it came into my head, that
it would not be any way creditable to be without
one, so when they let me speak, I answered
fair and softly, that you were Miss Gordon, going
home to your relations in Scotland; that
you were in trouble about one of them lately
dead, and wished to be as private as could be.
I had fifty offers of carriages from both ladies
and gentlemen, and one and all they say, that
such a beauty as yourself they never beheld.
One young gentleman followed after me, when
I returned thanks, and refused the rest; and
sure I was ready to sink into the earth with consternation
when he called me by my own name,
given me at my baptism fifty-two years ago.
'Rachel,' says he, as plain as you ever spoke the
word: 'Rachel,' says he, 'your lady is not unknown
to me. If I may have the honour of seeing
her, but for a moment, I will give her a
letter which she dropped in her way from the
ball-room, and entreat her to accept my best
services in any manner that may be most useful.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Sir,' says I, 'you have the advantage of
me, but I am much obliged, and will let my mistress
know all you say;' so here's the message,
and I am to take back your answer; but like a
noodle, I forgot to ask whose compliments I was
to bring you."</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind;" answered Zorilda,
in great agitation; "I do not know any
body; nor will I see any person. Go back;
request the gentleman to give you whatever letter
of mine he has found, and decline all farther
communication. Be civil, but firm, and bring
me no farther offers of assistance, which I do not
intend to accept."</p>

<p>Rachel saw that there was no use in attempting
to alter this determination, and though she
would have been well pleased to convey a more
conciliatory reply, she thought it prudent to do
as she was desired without farther comment.
The young gentleman waited her return, and
Rachel acquitted herself of her task, mitigating
the severity of a refusal, by assuring him how
grateful her Lady felt for his politeness.</p>

<p>"Give her back her letter then," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
stranger, who, during the interval of Rachel's
absence, had asked for a sheet of paper, and inclosed
it with these words:</p>

<p>"For worlds I would not be thought an intruder
by Zorilda, and I therefore submit to her
decision, which I anticipate. The letter accidentally
dropped in the hurry of her retreat is
now restored&mdash;extraordinary coincidence&mdash;by its
writer; and he who now returns it is no other
than the unseen guardian, who has for some
time past watched unperceived, and been the
fortunate means of saving much disquiet to her,
who, once seen, must be remembered <i>for ever</i>."</p>

<p>"Unaccountable, intricate, bewildering destiny!"
exclaimed Zorilda. "Can it be possible?
Have I met my father? Was it he who grasped
my hand? Have I refused a parent's request;
and is it he who returns the letter, which, by
a mysterious allotment of Providence (for who
but the infidel talks of chance) has been directed
to his hand?"</p>

<p>"Put such a notion out of your head, my
dear young lady," replied Rachel, who stood
behind, and of whose presence Zorilda was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
unconscious when she spoke aloud. "No, no;
the young gentleman who gave me that letter
for you might be your brother indeed, and not
much older than yourself; but as to being your
father, you need not perplex yourself on <i>that</i>
score. You have enough to be unhappy about,
my poor dear, without such fancies. If it was
the poor gentleman who was taken sick, and
came out of the ball-room ready to faint, and
drank a glass of water, and ordered his carriage
in the greatest hurry, and looked like one possessed
of an evil spirit; if <i>he</i> was the person
that gave me the letter, it would be quite a different
affair, for though a very fine man, tall as
a may-pole, and straight as an arrow, he could
not be less than forty, and a Lord into the
bargain&mdash;Lord, Lord&mdash;something beginning
with&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Oh! no more guessing," interrupted Zorilda,
"what have I to do with any one? Make
no inquiry, I charge you, I know enough.
Hasten my departure."</p>

<p>When Rachel disappeared to collect her luggage
and pay the bill, Zorilda, still pondering on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the events of the evening, now conjectured, that
the young unknown, to whom she was indebted
for some unexplained benefit, must be the person
against whose attempts to write to, or speak
with her, Algernon had given her an impressive
caution when he was going to Marchdale Court.
"Alas!" said she, "he need not have feared
a rival; but it is past. These feverish uncertainties
will soon have an end; and my beloved
friend, whose name is now my shield and safeguard,
will discover some retreat in which I
may hide my head and bury my sorrows."</p>

<p>The riot began to subside, the music ceased,
the last carriage rolled from the door, and a silvery
streak along the eastern horizon gave notice
of the coming day, when Zorilda's post-chaise
was ready to receive her.</p>

<p>"Since I have been delayed till after the departure
of these people," said she, "I will
make a little alteration in my route in hopes to
get rid of them. You see this map, Rachel,
look; we will turn into this road. It cannot
make the difference of more than five or six
miles; and <i>here</i> you see we shall come again into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the exact line of our journey when all this crowd
of revellers will have reached their several homes."
"You were always knowing in maps, and such
like," answered Rachel. "I know nothing but
to desire the post-boy to drive whichever way
you bid me; only take care not to go into any
bye place, where you will not find a chaise or
horses to take you on."</p>

<p>"We will lie by for the day then at the next
stage," replied Zorilda, "and perhaps it will be
no harm to do so; at all events, Rachel, I am
very ill. Come, let us be gone."</p>

<p>So saying, she hurried down stairs along the
squalid scene of departed festivity, assailed at
every step by an expiring lamp, or the remains
of a wassail bowl, at which the servants had
been liberally plied. Sick and weary, Zorilda
threw herself into the carriage, and blessed the
morning air, which breathed "wooingly" upon
her senses, and dispelled the horrible atmosphere
of the inn.</p>

<p>An officious hostler stood at the horses'
heads to prove that their fire required to be
restrained; but the fact was, that it was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
difficulty they could be urged from the door.
Zorilda desired that they might not be pushed
beyond their strength; and the postilion, making
a virtue of necessity, assuring her at the
same time that his "cattle" could easily go at
the rate of ten miles an hour, condescended
to let them go at the only pace of which they
were capable, a snail-slow walk, by which, in
course of time, they arrived at a house seven
miles on the stage of fifteen which they had to
go. Here the horses were to bait; and precisely
as the driver flourished his whip, to bring
his tired beasts up to the door with some sort of
<i>eclat</i>, a heavy waggon, which had just descended
a steep hill in the opposite direction, came in
such violent contact with the wheels of Zorilda's
chaise as to overturn it in an instant into
a deep ditch by the road side.</p>

<p>The people of the house ran to assist the travellers;
but Zorilda had fainted from the agony
of a dislocated wrist, and it was some time before
she could be extricated from her perilous
situation. At length she was conveyed into the
house, and laid upon a bed; while Rachel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
almost distracted with apprehension, implored
every body whom she met to go for a surgeon.
None was to be had nearer than the town
which they had left in the morning, and the
only expedient was to send off a man and horse,
but there was no horse in the stable at this poor
place, and all that remained was to dispatch
the post-boy with one of his tired steeds back
again. In the interim the dislocated joint
might become inflamed, and the greatest difficulty
occur in replacing it. Zorilda continued
insensible; Rachel ran nearly frantic out of the
house to way lay the passengers, if any were
haply going the road, who could assist her in
this distress. A horseman advanced.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Rachel; "I
will tell him what has happened, and he will
be a swifter messenger, if he will undertake the
thing, than this looby and his jaded beast."</p>

<p>Running to meet the gentleman, who approached
at a swinging trot, what was the poor
woman's joyful surprise to recognise the young
man who had restored the letter, and whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
left only a few short hours preceding, at the inn
where the ball had been given.</p>

<p>No time was lost, and even Rachel, loquacious
as was her usual habit, was brief on this
occasion. The stranger alighted in an instant,
and only employing the precaution of charging
Rachel on no account to divulge either to Miss
Gordon, or to any one whomsoever, her previous
acquaintance with him, flew to the apartment
in which Zorilda, suffering tortures of
pain, had just opened her eyes on the women
who were rubbing her forehead, applying burnt
feathers to her nostrils, and trying whatever
other scanty means the place supplied, to restore
animation. The young gentleman, whom
the patient at once concluded to be a medical
practitioner, immediately pulled the injured limb,
and with a powerful and skilful effort replaced
the joint. Then, calling for vinegar and spirits,
he bathed the hand and arm, which he bound,
and leaving Rachel to prepare for accompanying
her mistress to his father's house, which
was, he said close at hand, and from whence he
would immediately despatch a carriage for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
conveyance thither. He re-mounted his horse
with the rapidity of lightning, and disappeared
in an instant.</p>

<p>Before it was possible to imagine that he
could have ridden a mile and back again, he
returned with the family coach, in which his
sister had brought cushions, shawls, pillows, and
all sorts of accommodation for the invalid, whose
acute pain and fever, added to the tears of
Rachel, induced her to submit without resistance.
Zorilda suffered herself to be placed in
the coach, and conveyed to Sir Godfrey Cecil's
splendid abode, where, leaving her under medical
care, we must digress for a little while to explain
some circumstances connected with the
family amongst whom, she was now introduced
by the singular course of her fortunes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"I was born so high<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And dallies with the winds, and scorns the sun."<br /></span>

</p>


<p>Sir Godfrey Cecil derived De Lacy castle,
with the immense estates which descended to
him along with this noble remnant of feudal
pride, through a long line of ancestors, whose
gaunt effigies, clad in shining mail, lined the
great baronial hall, whose banners waved upon
his chapel walls, and whose proud escutcheons
were engraved upon those last records of departed
grandeur which still proclaim amid all
the pomp of heraldry, that dust hath to dust returned.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey had married early into the ancient
house of the De Burgho's and as he pored
with constantly renewed delight over the pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of Froissart, it was his favourite boast that every
name distinguished by that immortal chronicler,
was allied to him or to his consort the Lady
Grace. In fine there were few failures in
the moral code for which, though himself a man
of the correctest conduct, he could not have
more easily found excuse, than for obscurity of
birth.</p>

<p>Lady Grace paid the same devotion to hereditary
honours, and the general bearing of her
tastes and pursuits was in perfect accordance
with those of her husband. She knew the quarterings
of every shield, and there was not a crest
throughout the land with the device and history
of which Lady Grace Cecil was unacquainted.
Sir Godfrey and his wife, therefore, lived in all
the harmony of kind intercourse, and mutual
appeal upon those subjects which interested
them both most nearly; and were the best
friends imaginable, till any accidental occurrence
produced, or led to competition between
the merits of a Cecil and De Burgho. Angry
looks and taunting speech would then interrupt
domestic harmony; but, as such conflicts did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
not frequently happen, Sir Godfrey and Lady
Grace might be fairly called a very happy couple.
Making allowance for this single foible,
they were deservedly entitled to the character
which they held for all those qualities which
ought to adorn exalted birth. They were people
of lofty principle, unsullied honour, and
boundless munificence.</p>

<p>It was Sir Godfrey's rule that station makes
the man, and one of the first maxims which he
endeavoured to impress on the minds of his
children was, that every individual whose fortune
it was to be greatly born, owed it to his
pedigree not to disgrace the armorial bearings
committed to his safe custody, by a mean thought
or sordid action.</p>

<p>It was an apparent anomaly at De Lacy castle
that, though known to be as proud as Lucifer,
the affability of Sir Godfrey and his Lady
was a continual topic of popular praise. The
truth was, that they were <i>real</i> aristocrats. It
was not the paltry distinction of a new title, nor
the accidental acquisition of wealth, which they
held in esteem. Poverty was no crime in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
eyes. Alfred, turning the old woman's cakes at
the fire, was as truly great in their contemplation,
as Alfred dressed in ermined robes, and
seated on his kingly throne; but woe to the
Parvenû who entered their presence, however
studded over with stars and garters. They
would give gold to the needy, pity and protection
to the friendless, but honour was denied to
all who could not boast of ancient descent, and
he who was not able to trace his lineage to at
least the time of William the Conqueror, had
little chance of rendering himself a welcome
visitor, at the proud baronial residence to which
we have just introduced our readers.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey and Lady Grace had an only son
and daughter, and never were two young persons
more deserving of parental tenderness than Clara
and Lionel Cecil, who were at once "their father's
pride and mother's joy." The difficulties
which raised a barrier to sending their affections
abroad, had the happy effect of concentrating
them at home; and the mutual attachment of
this interesting brother and sister was a source
of unfailing delight to themselves, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
admiration to all who witnessed its pleasing influence
upon their manners and dispositions, to
which were added the attractions of fine talent
and external beauty.</p>

<p>We are often led to observe how puny are
the efforts of little man, with all his free-will, to
alter or disturb the general laws of providence.
If pride, for instance, always engendered pride,
and continued an increasing quality, this earthly
theatre would soon be too small for the pretensions
of an inflated few, but fortunately excess
of every kind carries its antidote along with the
bane, and re-action is frequently as favourable
to the growth of moral excellence as direct example;
hence a profligate father is not always
permitted to entail a curse upon his offspring,
who, disgusted by his evil courses, start into an
opposite track themselves. The miser is often
followed by a liberal son. The spendthrift succeeded
by one of economical habits. An age
of infidelity gives birth to a generation of believers;
one of fanaticism, to rational inquiry,
and thus while we are still invariably taught
that <i>motives</i> alone constitute virtue in individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
character, we perceive that limits are set to
the consequences of human vice; and all things
are so ordered as to work together for good upon
the great scale of creation. A striking confirmation
of this remark was exhibited by the children
of the house of Cecil, who, though they
entertained the sincerest veneration and affection
for their parents, were rather inclined to
take the opposite extreme of family pride, and
value too little that which they heard so much
overrated every day.</p>

<p>Lionel Cecil enjoyed every advantage which
wealth could impart, and repaid the care which
was bestowed upon his education, by making a
distinguished figure both at Eton and Oxford.
To a noble exterior, and splendid abilities, he
added all the lighter accomplishments, which
shine in mixed society. Full of youthful manliness
and grace, the natural gaiety of his spirits
was tempered by such a gentleness of disposition,
as served to soften, without enervating his
character. Never having had a brother, Clara
was the companion of his infant sports, and the
friend of riper years. The most perfect confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
subsisted between these amiable young
people who were twins in affection, though Lionel
was somewhat older than his sister.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that young Cecil made
one of a shooting party, which our readers may
remember at Thornton Abbey; and dined at
Henbury, in company with the Marquis of Turnstock
and a few others, invited thither by Algernon
Hartland. The exquisite beauty of Zorilda,
heightened by that shrinking timidity which shunned
the admiration which it excited, had struck
a lively impression on his feelings, which time
had not effaced from memory. The little he had
heard her speak, was addressed to Mr. Playfair,
but the pathetic sweetness of her voice lived on
his ear, as her image did in his heart. She looked
unhappy, and Lionel would have given a diadem
to know the subject of her sorrows, and
remove it. As he gazed upon her perfections,
he wished for those days of chivalry, of which
his father loved to tell the gallant feats performed
by his ancestors, and thought that no
such lovely Lady as Zorilda, had ever smiled
upon true knight in the olden time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The inquiries which were prompted by curiosity,
met with such reply as to stimulate romance
in the moment of arresting hope. "Who
is she?" "Nobody knows." What an answer
for the only son, heir, and representative
of the proudest family in England! "Whence
comes she?" "From a gipsey camp. How
she got there no one can tell."</p>

<p>Lionel was too honourable to cherish an idea
of clandestine love, and too good to make his
parents miserable. He must, therefore, banish
the idle vision, and shake off the sudden fascination
which entangled his heart. This determination
was aided after his return to Oxford,
by certain observations on the manner of young
Hartland, whenever Lord Turnstock rallied him
on the subject of Zorilda's beauty, which had
not been carelessly remarked by the Marquess
as circumstances proved in the sequel. From
some indications which were exhibited on such
occasions, Lionel concluded that an engagement
already subsisted between Algernon and the
charming Spaniard.</p>

<p>When this conviction stole upon his mind he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
gave a sigh, and could not refrain from saying
to himself, "How happy are those, who, free to
follow the bent of inclination, may taste the
sweets of mutual love unshackled by these bonds,
these galling chains of feudal despotism!"</p>

<p>This sigh, however, was the last. Lionel resolved
to hold no dalliance with his duty, and
with a manly resolution he plucked from his
breast the forbidden thought, and had forgotten
the short-lived dream which, for a time, murdered
his repose, when Lord Turnstock arrived
from the Continent. Lionel had never liked
him, and now less than ever; he spoke of his
former friend and ally Hartland in terms of unmeasured
hatred and contempt, and one evening
let out in convivial openness, that he was
planning a good trick to vex him, adding, in a
careless way, "by the bye, can any one tell me
of that Spanish girl, that handsome gipsey who
lives at Hartland's house? I have some
business to transact with her."</p>

<p>These words were repeated accidentally to
Cecil by one of the party, who thought that he
could perceive some connection between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
"good trick," and the Spanish gipsey. Cecil
thought so too, and resolved, as far as he was
able, to avert danger from Zorilda by giving
her such warning as to put her effectually on
her guard, till the arrival of her lover should
place her in security.</p>

<p>With this generous design, Lionel set out on
a visit of a few days to Thornton Abbey, having
had the satisfaction of seeing Lord Turnstock
unexpectedly called in another direction by the
death of a relation, from whom he hoped for a
legacy. Cecil justly surmised, that this would
give a new turn to the Marquess' thoughts, for
a short time at least, and afford him the desired
opportunity of frustrating any scheme inimical
to Zorilda's safety. When he reached the
neighbourhood of Henbury he made himself
acquainted with Zorilda's daily habits, and conveyed
the letter before mentioned in the manner
already described. Clara was the only person
to whom he had ever spoken of Zorilda, with
whom his late meeting at the ball was purely
accidental; and for her sake, as well as his own,
he now wished with scrupulous care to suppress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
every hint of his having been the person who
sent her a message through Rachel at the inn.
Such intelligence might produce embarrassment
on her part, and render her anxious to
leave De Lacy castle before her health was sufficiently
re-established to encounter a journey;
and for himself, the slightest acknowledgment of
former acquaintance with, or interest concerning
Zorilda, would infallibly awaken alarm in
the minds of Sir Godfrey and Lady Grace.</p>

<p>Secrecy being therefore determined upon, an
able surgeon was immediately sent for, who
found his patient extremely feverish. After
bandaging the injured wrist, and administering
a composing draught, he ordered perfect quiet,
and took his leave, promising to pay an early
visit on the following day. Nothing could surpass
the kindness with which the sick stranger
was treated by the whole family, and she had
been nearly twelve hours under the roof before
Lady Grace asked, "Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Some Miss Gordon," answered Clara, "returning
to her family in Scotland.</p>

<p>"The name is a good one," replied Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Cecil. "Did you hear, my love, whether she is
of the&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Her maid, I believe," said Miss Cecil,
hastily, "is no genealogist. She looks like an
old heir-loom in the shape of a nurse, who has
been more conversant with swaddling-clothes
than coats of arms; but I am sure that Miss
Gordon <i>must</i> be of a good stock, she is so pretty
and so elegant."</p>

<p>"That is a fallacious test, as I have often told
you," rejoined Lady Cecil. "To be sure it
little signifies when we are merely called upon
to relieve distress, what rank the sufferer holds
in the Herald's Court. We reserve <i>that</i> inquiry
for our friendships and alliances."</p>

<p>Clara being afraid of displeasing her mother
by an ill-timed remark on the possibility of
giving one's confidence, and affection too,
without referring to her mother's favourite
volume, entitled, "Norroy King at Arms,"
contented herself with assenting to the first
branch of her proposition, while the latter was
left undisputed, and went to inquire whether
there was any thing that she could do for her
guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>On the surgeon's return next day Zorilda's
fever had greatly increased, and the accident
which she had met with only appeared its accelerating,
not original cause. Her mind was the
real seat of malady. The unkindness of Lady
Marchdale, and the perfidy of her once beloved
Algernon, preyed upon her innocent heart,
while the occurrence of such strange events as
she had lately experienced, confused her head.
On the third day of her illness she became delirious,
and raved incessantly of all that weighed
upon her spirit, but so incoherently, that none
who was ignorant of her story could draw any
collected evidence from the wild and whirling
words which she uttered. The name of Algernon,
however, escaped her lips so often as to
convince young Cecil, to whom his sister reported
all she heard, that a deep attachment
existed in Zorilda's breast, of which Lord Hautonville
was the object.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Lionel, "the sweet girl has
little knowledge of the man to whom she has
betrothed her guileless heart. Her pure mind
arrays the image of its devotion in the colours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
her own glowing fancy, and represents the object
of her love as he should be, not as he is. I
would not have <i>you</i>, my Clara, married to Lord
Hautonville though he wore a crown imperial,
and could trace his pedigree through a <i>forest</i>,
instead of a single <i>tree</i>."</p>

<p>"I neither love crowns nor pedigrees for
myself," replied Clara; "but we must not let
the artless Zorilda be deceived. We must
devise means of snatching her from future
misery, if you know the object of her regards to
be unworthy of them."</p>

<p>"It is a delicate task," answered Cecil, "but
she may perhaps have made discoveries, the
pain of which now presses on her feeble frame.
I have questioned her attendant, who is a niggard
of her information, or ignorant of what I
want to know. Yet still I can gather, that this
lovely creature has been harshly treated by Lady
Marchdale, whose aversion to the idea of her son's
alliance with the friendless Zorilda, I conclude
to be the cause of a manner so contrary to her
former kindness. Perhaps the noble minded
stranger may have set out upon this journey to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
remove all solicitude from the minds of her benefactors,
and make a sacrifice of her own inclination
to her sense of honour and virtue; but
what a man must he be, who, knowing himself
in possession of Zorilda's affections, can thus
basely desert her?"</p>

<p>"He may not know of the sacrifice," said
Clara. "Upon proposing to the old nurse to
write to Miss Gordon's friends, and inform
them of her present situation, she conjured me
to preserve an inviolable secrecy respecting her,
alleging the probable speedy termination of her
illness, and the fear of alarming her relations, as
the pretext for silence; but so extraordinary
was the poor woman's vehemence, so urgent her
entreaty, that I could not help feeling that
'more was meant than met the ear.'"</p>

<p>A physician who was called concurred with
surgeon Crump, that no danger of contagion
was to be dreaded, and Clara took advantage of
this assurance to bestow the tenderest care on
her guest, frequently stealing from her own
room at night, to take Rachel's post and send
her to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Zorilda's illness was both tedious and alarming,
and several weeks elapsed before her medical
attendants pronounced their patient convalescent.
Such a time however arrived, and
the benevolence which offered asylum to distress
now met its full reward. The doctors, however,
insisted particularly on the utmost caution, and
to Zorilda's earnest prayer to be told how soon
she might resume her journey, constantly replied,
that as a relapse would probably be fatal, she
owed it to her friends as well as to herself to avoid
the risk of one. She was permitted however to
leave her chamber, and enjoy the society of her
kind hosts in an adjoining dressing-room, where
she received the most friendly congratulations
on her recovery. Sir Godfrey, who had not
seen his fair ward till now, was fascinated by her
beauty, which late illness had only rendered
more touching: and whatever impression was
made by Zorilda's exterior form, was confirmed
by her manners and conversation. Gratitude
called upon her for every exertion to repay
such kindness as she had found, and ere many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
days were past, that which at first was effort, became
inclination.</p>

<p>Armed with the honourable determination to
preserve his heart from all entanglement, under
the full persuasion that Zorilda's was already
attached to another object, Lionel gave himself
freely up to the charms of an intercourse, rendered
the more seductive from the supposed
security of the case, and Zorilda's dressing-room
became the scene of all that delicate attention
and polished taste could devise for her amusement.
Clara had her harp and guitar transported
thither, and delighted her young friend
by the sweetest music, when she feared that conversation
might exhaust her, while Lionel came
laden with fresh stores of books and fine prints
with which to beguile the hours, which flew on
golden pinion.</p>

<p>One day, on the return of Clara and her brother
from attending Sir Godfrey and Lady
Cecil in a visit of ceremony, Zorilda, who believing
them all absent had been singing some
of her softest melodies to the guitar, was surprised
by her young friends, who stood for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
long time outside the door of her apartment,
held in bondage there by the captivation of her
plaintive voice. This discovery opened a new
source of attraction, and Clara, who loved nothing
in creation like Lionel, began to grow
uneasy lest society so congenial, and becoming
each day more and more ensnaring, should produce
too much present gratification for his
future repose.</p>

<p>"I almost wish the day of parting were
arrived," said she, as she held her brother's arm
in a stroll in the pleasure-grounds. "This
Spanish Syren will become too necessary to us,
and we shall not know how to live without her."</p>

<p>Lionel started, and seemed to feel the truth
of Clara's apprehension, but instantly repressing
the emotion which her remark had excited,
he answered with an assumed firmness, which
imposed upon his sister as well as himself,</p>

<p>"She would indeed be a dangerous visitor
here, were not the certainty that her affections
are pre-occupied a perfect safeguard against the
sorcery of such loveliness and modesty as never
before appeared in union with such various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
talents. Zorilda is a wonder of nature, but I
never look on her without repeating my <i>lesson</i>&mdash;that
she belongs to another; that with Lady
Hautonville I have no other bond than that
which a singular coincidence of romantic circumstances
has thrown in my way. She is a
stranger here, and will depart hence, leaving,
it may be, such a standard of female excellence
in one's mind, as to increase the difficulties of
falling in love elsewhere; but as I am in no
haste to marry, and our good father has no
<i>crotchet</i> in his head for me, you may set your
anxieties to sleep, and let us not be over wise in
our prudence."</p>

<p>Clara was satisfied and returned to Zorilda's
dressing-room, lightened of a weight which had
oppressed her.</p>

<p>The security which Lionel only imagined,
was real in Zorilda's instance. Her soul was
fortified by feelings of pain so deeply seated,
that though the happiness of companionship,
and the sympathy of kindness, such as she now
experienced, had power to soothe, they had
none to change her heart, which was sealed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
by her misfortunes, to every impression of a
dangerous sort; while the total absence of vanity
in her character, precluded all suspicion
of that effect which she produced on others.
Increasing strength extended the permission of
indulgence, and the invalid was allowed to take
the air.</p>

<p>The gardens and grounds around De Lacy
castle were worthy of that sumptuous edifice,
which stood in the midst of scenery rendered
doubly delightful in Zorilda's eyes by her long
confinement; and the enthusiastic admiration
which she bestowed upon the surrounding landscape,
flattered the pride of Sir Godfrey as
much as it excited a tenderer interest in the
mind of his son. Time rolled on, and Zorilda,
who saw how genuine was the expression of sorrow
in Clara's countenance, whenever she spoke
of departure, had refrained from questioning
her physician. Her hand was still too weak to
hold a pen; and she had, for obvious reasons,
declined all offers of informing her Scotch
friends, through any other medium, of her situation.
Nay, she even rejoiced, on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
account, that they were as ignorant of her present
retreat as the family of Henbury, since, should
the latter desire to pursue or recall her, what so
natural as to apply for information concerning
movements to the only persons with whom she
had ever formed a bond of friendship?</p>

<p>But Zorilda was not insensible to the extraordinary
appearance which her neglected condition
must wear in the eyes of her hosts, who
did frequently express their astonishment that
no letters arrived for their guest. At length
our heroine, struggling to overcome the reluctance
with which she resolved on tearing herself
from those whose truth and tenderness had
won upon her heart, producing the fullest return
of all that she had to give, imparted to
Miss Cecil her fixed design to pursue her purpose,
and set out in a few days for Scotland,
adding,</p>

<p>"My beloved Clara will not endeavour to
dissuade me any longer from doing what she
would herself feel to be right and necessary,
were our situations reversed; what must Sir
Godfrey and Lady Cecil think of a deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
wanderer, thus apparently bereft of all the natural
ties that bind to house, to home, to kindred?"</p>

<p>"They have been prevented from wondering
much upon this subject," answered Clara, "by
my brother's care, and my own, to assure them
that you are incapable of any but the highest
and the best motives for concealment. That
none but parents possess such rights as to make
it strange that, in default of their claims, of
which perhaps death may have deprived you,
your silence respecting an accident which has
blessed us with your society during a few short
weeks, has spared the feelings of more distant
relatives, who may expect with less solicitude
than would be a father or a mother's portion.
Am I right? And if I am, have we no claims
to urge? Oh, Zorilda! I know not how to part
with you."</p>

<p>"Dear generous being!" exclaimed Zorilda,
embracing her friend. "Such confidence must
and shall be requited. Yes, you shall one day
be made acquainted with the mysterious circumstances."</p>

<p>At this moment, a tap at the dressing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
door, was followed by the entrance of Lady
Cecil, leaning on the arm of her son.</p>

<p>"I will ask Miss Gordon myself," said the
former, as if in continuation of preceding discourse
with Lionel.</p>

<p>"We were just talking, my dear, of your uncommon
name, which I maintain is Spanish, and
as you know that I am a bit of a genealogist,
I have been puzzling my brain to recollect how
it happened to fall amongst the Gordons. Now
that you are able to speak without fatigue, you
shall tell us all about it. I dare say that there
is some romantic tale of other days which I shall
delight to hear, though I much wonder that my
excellent friend of Drumcairn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drumcairn! Good Heavens do you know
the Gordons of Drumcairn?" interrupted Zorilda,
whose sudden surprise sent a vivid blush
into her cheeks, which was followed by the lily's
hue.</p>

<p>"To be sure I do. The Gordons of Drumcairn?
They were here last summer. Mr.
Gordon is one of my oldest friends, one of the
best families in Europe. How is he related to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
you, my dear? I am so glad that I happened
to mention Drumcairn!"</p>

<p>"It is to Drumcairn that I am going," said
Zorilda, deeply agitated.</p>

<p>"Well, well, this is really quite a <i>hit</i>," answered
Lady Cecil, "and I see that you are as
much struck by the coincidence as I am. But
how can all this be? You are not niece to my
good friend; for, if I remember rightly, his brother
left only two sons behind him. Then for
his sisters; the elder, Janet, married a Mackensie;
and the younger a Stuart. How do
you stand, my dear, with respect to the Drumcairn
branch? I am quite charmed to find out
who you are, and you have the Gordon features
too."</p>

<p>Zorilda never was formed for dissimulation of
any kind, and, though she met a glance of transport
from Clara's eye, and felt an answering
gleam of joy from Lionel's countenance, she
quickly dispelled both the one and the other by
confessing the truth.</p>

<p>"The family of Drumcairn are not related
to me at all, except by the tenderest friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
on their parts towards a solitary orphan," replied
Zorilda.</p>

<p>Lady Cecil drew back, and with less beaming
aspect, looked steadily at her blushing guest.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my young friend," said
she, "perhaps I distress you; but I <i>thought</i> I
knew every Gordon in the world," and with
a half disdainful, half incredulous air, added,
"perhaps it is better to inquire no farther; all
people do not trouble their heads about relationship
after <i>my</i> fashion, <i>you</i> have no taste for
heraldry I suppose."</p>

<p>So saying, Lady Cecil rose from her chair to
leave the room, when Zorilda caught her hand,
and bursting into tears drew it towards her lips.</p>

<p>"Accept, oh, accept the most grateful tribute
of a broken heart. I have no right to the name
of Gordon, and never assumed it. You shall
not be deceived as the base return for all your
goodness. Dear Madam, I am, it is true, without
a name, and know little of a science with
which I have no concern; but I have a glowing
sense of all I owe to your generous hospitality;
and alas! I can only repay it by lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
myself in your esteem. In two days I shall quit
your princely abode, and may never have the
happiness of beholding you again. Before I
leave De Lacy castle Miss Cecil shall be put
in possession of my sad, my romantic story."</p>

<p>Zorilda's emotion would scarcely permit her
to utter these words. Lady Cecil appeared
agitated also. She was naturally enough
shocked by any appearance of deception in one
whom she had harboured so long under the
roof with her only daughter. Yet the purity
and candour of Zorilda's whole deportment,
seemed to repel all doubt. Again, she felt glad
that one day more would conclude the adventure,
and while she rejoiced in getting rid of
one in whose station in society she was disappointed,
she felt it a pity to spoil preceding
kindness by a cold farewell.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most awkward and angry feeling
in Lady Cecil's mind, arose at this instant from
the recollection that she had laid herself open
to a smile of ridicule, by her discovery of that
strong likeness to the Gordon physiognomy,
for which it now appeared there was no foundation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
In short, whatever were the combination,
her feelings were not pleasant, and beckoning
to her son, whose countenance betrayed the deep
interest which he took in the scene, she slightly
inclined her head, and left the room.</p>

<p>"I have lost your mother's favour," said Zorilda,
as she leaned on the bosom of her weeping
friend, "but I must not repine. "<i>Who is
she?</i>" was the brand set on the frontlet which
bound my infant brows, and it is indelible.
Will Clara, too, cast me off, and hate me because
I have none other to love and shelter me?"</p>

<p>"I would give my life for you," replied her
friend, "and so would&mdash;" but, suddenly pausing,
Zorilda entreated her to leave the apartment.
"My time is short," added she, "and I must
set all things in order for my departure. You
shall have my narrative to-night, for I am resolved
to go to-morrow; read it to your family,
and return it to me before you retire to rest. I
will avoid seeing Sir Godfrey and Lady Cecil
again; my presence can only distress them; but
my gratitude will only end with life, and
memory, my Clara, will not be exercised in far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
distant retrospects. My days will be few, and
sorrowful: I feel it here (as she laid her hand
upon her heart), and Zorilda will soon have
passed away like an evening shadow."</p>

<p>A fond embrace was all the comfort which
Clara could impart, and she withdrew with feelings
of wonder, sympathy, and admiration, too
big for expression.</p>

<p>Rachel received orders to prepare for the
journey, and never felt less inclined to obey
than upon this occasion. She could have spent
the remnant of her days well pleased in the
luxurious ease of De Lacy castle, and had
been long indulging a secret hope that two
people, so formed for each other as its young
Lord and her gentle mistress, should one day
conclude the romance which brought them together
in the usual way, by a happy union.
Rachel loved a novel, next to her tea, better
than any earthly solace, and had found rich
stores of literary food, as well as Congo, at the
castle; but in all her reading she had never
stumbled upon a single instance in which faithful
love was not rewarded. Now, that Lionel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
loved Zorilda was her firm persuasion, not only
because Rachel could not imagine <i>any</i> one secure
against the attractions of her mistress, but
she had too much sagacity, not to interpret the
thousand kind attentions which she received
herself from Mr. Cecil, as well as the pleasure
which he seemed to feel in talking of Zorilda's
improved health and appearance.</p>

<p>But Rachel buried these happy thoughts in
her own breast, as, though Zorilda's manners
were of dove-like softness, there was a native
dignity in her demeanour which repelled all
attempt at vulgar familiarity; and Rachel had
sufficient tact to know exactly how far she might
go, and where it was prudent to stop. She
had never ventured therefore upon the slightest
allusion to her hopes, and now set about the performance
of her task with silent reluctance, while
Zorilda endeavoured to compose her thoughts,
and throw together a few brief outlines of her story,
from the time of her removal from the gipsey camp
to Henbury, by way of supplement to the narrative
communicated to her by Mr. Playfair.</p>

<p>Nothing was suppressed in her artless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
affecting sketch, except the attachment between
her and Algernon. This was a sacred theme.
She alleged no motives, therefore, for Lady
Marchdale's changed regards, and only stated,
that having been conscious of altered feelings
towards her, she could no longer endure to be a
burthen on the kindness of her former friends,
and had consequently resolved on sparing them
all farther solicitude on her account, though circumstances
of a peculiar nature prevented her
from revealing her intentions, or informing her
late benefactors of her retreat, till her future
way of life should have assumed some fixed
shape and character.</p>

<p>On leaving Zorilda, Clara had quitted the
house to indulge in a solitary ramble the grief
with which she felt oppressed as she contemplated
the approaching separation from one who
had become so dear to her, and whom she was
forced into the painful belief was likely to prove
a source of misery to her brother. "Alas!"
said she, soliloquizing as she wandered onwards,
"he loves her, and the more devotedly, because
his generous soul disdained to acknowledge danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
while honour imposed silence on his wishes.
He will be silent still, but he will be unhappy."</p>

<p>While Clara pondered these melancholy forebodings,
Lionel was seeking for her, and at
length overtook his sister, pale and breathless,
with a newspaper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Here, Clara," said he, "is something strange.
It struck my father, who brought it just now to
me. I felt little appetite for news, but feared to
offend, if I refused to look at what excited his
curiosity, and my attention was soon arrested.
I am certain that I know all the actors in this
horrible catastrophe, and that it is interwoven
with Zorilda's fate."</p>

<p>Clara snatched the paper, and read aloud the
following paragraph:</p>

<p>"For obvious reasons of a delicate nature, we
forbear from alluding openly to the noble individuals
who are involved in the tragical circumstances
at which we glanced in a former number.
Subsequent information, we regret to say, from
an authentic source, leaves no doubt as to the
painful fact, that a young nobleman, Lord H.,
whose family has been recently exalted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
succession to the peerage, has shot a nobleman, with
whom not long since he was considered as being
closely <i>lié</i>, and who now lies dangerously ill at
Brussels. The cause of this lamentable occurrence
continues to be wrapped in the profoundest mystery,
but immediately after the dreadful act, the
unhappy perpetrator made a voluntary surrender
of himself to the civil authorities, to abide his
trial; and it is rumoured, that his noble parents,
of whom he is the only child, have set out for the
Netherlands, plunged in the severest affliction.
As a little time must fully develop this dark
transaction, we shall abstain from any comment
upon it, under present circumstances."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, a terrible story, if true; but
what reference can it have to Zorilda?" asked
Clara, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I see it plainly," answered Lionel. "The
recent succession; the former intimate friendship,
and present enmity; an only child; the
letter H, which is given as an initial; every circumstance,
in short, to my mind, points out
Lord Hautonville as the unfortunate young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
gentleman who has killed the Marquess of Turnstock."</p>

<p>"You may be wrong," said Clara, "and all
these signs may belong to some other persons.
What does my father say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. He has no suspicion at all
about the matter, and is unacquainted with the
actors in this tragedy altogether."</p>

<p>"And did you hint your own surmise?"</p>

<p>"No; I thought it better to conceal the entire
from Zorilda, who, as she does not dine below
stairs, will not be liable to hear any discussion
which might alarm her. If the truth be as
I suppose, nay, as some unaccountable internal
evidence assures me it is, she will soon be made
acquainted with the fatal particulars, but I
wanted to consult you on the possibility of detaining
her here, by informing the <i>rulers</i> of my
conjecture."</p>

<p>"Dismiss the idea from your mind," said
Clara: "The greatest kindness we can now
show this dear girl, is to hasten her departure,
or at least not retard it. The tide has turned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
my mother has infused her doubts into my father's
mind, and they are both restlessly impatient
till she is gone. I saw the whole train on
fire before I left the house, though there hardly
seemed time to have put the match to it; but it
is evident that previous doubts only required the
slightest grain of probability to decide the question
against our sweet forlorn Zorilda, and her
confession that she does not belong to the house
of Gordon has ruined her. My only hope is
in the effect which may be produced by the recital
of her history, which we are to have this
evening, and for which I am myself burning
with impatience. Who <i>can</i> she be? and, who
are the parents who could cast such a creature
on the merciless world?"</p>

<p>"I long to know as much as you can do,"
answered Lionel; "and believe that you counsel
prudently. We must let things work and wait
the issue."</p>

<p>"She must go," replied Clara; "and it will
be better for her&mdash;for us all, that she should do
so. We must not censure those, who with more
experience of life, and less enthusiasm than you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and I possess, are slower in deciding on merit.
I would not have Zorilda stay for all the indulgence
of her society to myself. She would be
looked on with an evil eye, and watched with
jealous apprehension."</p>

<p>"And would defy all scrutiny to detect one
dissembled thought," said Lionel, with warmth.</p>

<p>"Yes; but we must not detain her here to
be suspected. We must let her go to Drumcairn;
and the attachment of the Gordons towards
her will be better proof of her deserts
than all that you and I could assert in her
favour."</p>

<p>Lionel, seized with avidity on this view, which
seemed to open into a new vista of hope, that
sparkled in his eye. "Come," said he, "let
us return. We must caution Rachel not to suffer
a newspaper to fall in her mistress' way till
she reaches the end of her journey. Alas! that
journey! Oh Clara! we shall feel an aching
void when she is gone!"</p>

<p>The brother and sister returned home, and
instructed Rachel in her lesson.</p>

<p>Clara and her friend passed the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of the day together in mutual regrets at parting&mdash;professions
of unalterable attachment, and
promises of future correspondence. Lionel made
but one attempt to interrupt the <i>tête-à-tête</i>; and
then exhibited so much emotion, in spite of all
his efforts at concealment, that Zorilda became
embarrassed; and Clara, dreading some painful
<i>eclaircissement</i>, prevailed on her brother, by a
supplicating look, to leave the room.</p>

<p>When Lionel was gone, Zorilda, blushing violently,
and taking Clara's hand, entreated her to
grant the request which she was going to make.</p>

<p>"Your kind brother and you will be desirous
to perform the duties of hospitality to the last
hour; but you must indulge my wishes. I cannot
see either of you in the morning. <i>You</i> will
deliver the packet, which I am to entrust to
your care this evening, into my hands here in
this dressing-room before you go to bed; but I
conjure you to prevent me from seeing any of
your family after they have become acquainted
with my history. I feel unspeakable pain at
confiding the strange events of my life to your
parents; but I am impelled by gratitude to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
assure them, as far as I can, that they have not
thrown away their charity upon an impostor.
I feel it due also to myself to prove, that I am
not willingly or needlessly a young female adventurer,
assuming an air of mystery and romance
to win upon curiosity or benevolence.
Alas! I <i>am</i> truly what I <i>seem</i>. I may be
spurned with contempt, but I will try and make
myself believed. Promise&mdash;<i>faithfully</i> promise,
that I shall see none but yourself after the reading
of my narrative."</p>

<p>Clara felt the energy with which this petition
was urged; and the quickness of her penetration
unravelled the true cause of Zorilda's earnestness.
Lionel's looks and manners, though
guarded by the strictest care, betrayed those
feelings which are never more powerfully expressed
than when they most assiduously seek to
avoid all expression. Zorilda had long resisted
every demonstration; but there is a language
which those who have felt the influence of a
strong attachment within their own breasts, cannot,
if they would, misunderstand; and Zorilda
had been forced into a reluctant conviction, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
she was dear to Lionel. A conviction, the more
painful, because he was, of all earthly beings,
the man in whose breast it was most agonizing
to her heart to plant a thorn. Lionel's was, in
fact, of all human characters, that which, most
resembling Zorilda's, would have drawn upon
every sympathy of her nature, had not her pre-occupied
affections been sealed to every sentiment
which might shake their rooted hold.
She had, it is true, too keen a sense of moral
perfection not to perceive young Cecil's merit
in its full extent. She had sometimes caught
herself in making involuntary comparisons between
Algernon and him. She had even started
from herself, as she had once mentally exclaimed,
"Oh did he but resemble Lionel!"
The sentence was never finished, even in her
heart; and the aspiration so pure that angels
might have witnessed it, seemed, to the scrupulous
sensibility of Zorilda's soul, a species of inconstancy
towards the idol whom she had worshipped
from earliest, happiest, purest infancy,
for which she had found it difficult to forgive
herself. Algernon existed no longer for her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
but his image was enshrined in her memory;
and though he had ceased to be worthy of her
love, she never dreamed of bestowing it upon
another.</p>

<p>"Why did I refuse to tie myself by a vow?"
would she sometimes say as she mused on the
past, "but because the free-will offering of a
broken heart is as certain as a sickly bond
could make it."</p>

<p>But Zorilda began to perceive that Lionel
loved her, and dreaded nothing so much as a
disclosure of feelings which she could not repay
in kind. She was therefore urgent in her
entreaty to Clara, that she might be allowed to
glide away unnoticed, and her friend easily promised
for herself. The bitterness of a farewell,
perhaps for ever, was too deeply felt, to make
her anxious to pronounce it.</p>

<p>The evening hour arrived, and Zorilda put
her packet into the hands of Miss Cecil, who
hastened to the library where her father, mother,
and brother were assembled. The narrative
was read; the diamond cross examined,
the miniature admired; the whole pondered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
but very different were the feelings which these
interesting memoranda produced in the minds
of the old and the young. Sir Godfrey and his
Lady were evidently displeased, and though
they did not refuse their pity, it was mingled
with distrust.</p>

<p>"The story is very extraordinary," said Lady
Cecil, "and may be correctly told; but there
is something so undefined in the whole narration,
that after all the mind is left in utter confusion.
After all, we are not informed who she is,
nor who her parents were; nor is there any
elucidation of her conduct in quitting the asylum
of her youth. There is a cloud hanging over
her desertion of those tried friends and early
benefactors, which requires clearing up."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sir Godfrey, "the nature
of her offence must have been serious to call
for a change of manner on the part of Lady
Marchdale; and I confess that my opinion of
this wandering damsel is not improved, though
many charitable allowances may be made; but
I fear there is something of the gipsey about
her still. I do not like these heroines, and am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
very glad that without committing an act of
harshness, we shall get rid of her to-morrow.
Clara, my love, you are young and enthusiastic.
I know how much you have been feeling for
this stranger, whose beauty has irresistibly inspired
an interest in her favour, to which perhaps
she is not justly entitled. Your mother very properly
remarks that a cloud at present hangs over
her character, and till we learn what reception
she meets with at Drumcairn, whither she says
that she is going, I must insist on your avoiding
all sort of correspondence with this giddy
girl. If the Gordons continue their friendship
towards her, I shall have no objection to your
writing to her now and then hereafter, if you
wish it."</p>

<p>Clara sighed, and bowed her head in token of
submission to parental authority; but Lionel,
eager only to justify Zorilda, exclaimed, "What
Sir! must a helpless stranger be condemned
unheard? Cannot a case be easily imagined,
which, far from imparting censure to the conduct
of your guest, raises every feeling of admiration
for the noble principle which governs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
her every thought, as well as action? Suppose,
for a moment that her uncommon attractions
had inspired sentiments in the breast of Lord
Hautonville, more powerful than those which
knit the hearts of children at that early age
when first the lovely little Spaniard was brought
home to be his play-fellow, may it not be that
the high minded Zorilda, fearing that those to
whom she owed every thing might not approve
a union which the cold maxims of worldly prudence
calls unequal, has left the asylum of her
youth&mdash;perhaps the scene of her fondest affections,
to give an exalted proof of gratitude, by
the sacrifice of all her earthly happiness. Such
magnanimity would be in perfect accordance
with all that I know of Miss Gordon's character."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Lionel," replied Sir
Godfrey, "you are apparently a practised advocate.
Either you know more of <i>Miss Gordon's</i>
affairs, or conjecture takes a wonderfully
favourable turn for her acquittal." The name
of Gordon was pronounced with emphasis,
while Sir Godfrey's countenance wore an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
expression of the most bitterly sarcastic scrutiny.
Lionel coloured, and, hurried forward by his
feelings, would instantly have betrayed all that
he knew of Henbury and its inhabitants, if a
beseeching look from Clara had not arrested
the recital. Suddenly recovering himself, he
told his father that the laws of the land required
delinquency to be proved before guilt is imputed,
and that he had done no more than
suggest a <i>probable</i> case.</p>

<p>"A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind,
they say," replied Sir Godfrey, with a sneer.
"I suppose that your own heart is the storehouse
of your <i>probabilities</i>. Lionel, this is not a subject
to be trifled with. I must have some
serious conversation with you, and desire that
you will meet me here to-morrow after breakfast.
In the meantime you may consult your
pillow upon some topics connected with this
letter, which I received to-day from the Duke of
Kingsbury."</p>

<p>So saying, Sir Godfrey quitted the room,
Lady Cecil retired, and Clara employed a moment's
interval before she followed her mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in pressing the necessity of secrecy and discretion
on Lionel's mind, and imploring him to
recollect Zorilda's request that she might be
suffered to depart on the following morrow
without observation.</p>

<p>"I will open the last gate of the great avenue,
nothing shall prevent me from taking our
farewell look," said Lionel, "and so good
night."</p>

<p>Clara having listened to a lecture from Lady
Cecil on the folly of yielding to benevolent
feelings, without considering consequences, and
heard how severely she reproached herself for
having permitted a nameless wanderer to sleep
a night beneath her roof, hastened to her
friend's apartment. Zorilda rose to meet her,
and as Clara restored the packet, a long and
tender embrace conveyed more eloquently than
language is capable of doing, the impression
which it had made upon her heart. Not a
word was spoken, but a thousand promises of
unalterable love were interchanged, in the tears
which choked their utterance.</p>

<p>The earliest dawn, found Zorilda stealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
softly along the little velvet lawn which skirted
Clara's garden, from which as she passed, she
gathered a wild honeysuckle which seemed to
have strayed over the paling on purpose to
breathe its fragrant adieus at her feet.</p>

<p>"Balm of the wilderness! that floats upon
the pilgrim's path! what desert too revolting,
what solitude too dreary for thy errant charities?
Emblem of the brief and honied dream of kindness
here, too sweet for more than passing
breath upon the gale, thy farewell shall exhale
upon Zorilda's grateful bosom."</p>

<p>Thus apostrophizing the trailing wreath, she
pulled one of its golden flowers, which, placing
next her heart, and casting one fond, lingering
look at the turrets of De Lacy, she reached the
carriage, in which Rachel was already seated,
and ordering the postilion to keep along a
narrow green lane at the back of the castle, as
if actuated by some hidden impulse to avoid the
great avenue, the travellers gained the high road,
at the distance of more than a mile from the
principal entrance, where Lionel waited their
approach, with feelings of sorrow and agitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
not to be described. He loitered for an hour
amongst the cedars, which formed a dark screen
round the porter's-lodge, before the truth struck
upon his mind. Starting then, as if from sleep,
he dashed across the park, and gaining the narrow
lane by which Zorilda had left his father's
lordly abode, he needed not to ask a question.
The fresh traces of her recent departure told
their own story; and a sensation of inexpressible
agony followed the assurance that Zorilda was
gone. The first impulse was to mount his horse,
and pursue the lovely fugitive; but Clara's
anxious eye had watched her friend's device,
and seen her brother return from his fruitless
endeavour to obtain a parting glimpse of her
whose image was engraven in his inmost heart;
and she hastened towards him.</p>

<p>"Beware, dearest Lionel," said his weeping
sister; "intrude not on Zorilda's grief. She
has effected her retreat in this manner to avoid
giving and receiving pain; we must respect her
purpose; remember what affliction is yet in
store for this young martyr when she knows the
horrible tidings of her lover's present situation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Lionel shuddered involuntarily as Clara uttered
the word "lover," and, suffering himself
to be led by Clara's arm, accompanied her in
sullen apathy towards the house.</p>

<p>"My father will expect you presently in the
study. Have you looked at the letter which he
gave you last night?" said Clara.</p>

<p>Lionel had never bestowed a thought upon it,
and now feeling in his pocket, drew it out, and
dashed it on the ground.</p>

<p>"I am in no humour to read letters; there!
give it back to Sir Godfrey, I cannot keep his
appointment now." Saying these words, he
disengaged himself from his sister's hold, and
would have turned into another walk, but she
seized, and, forcibly detaining him, entreated
earnestly for Zorilda's sake that he would be
calm. "You may injure <i>her</i> by this violence,"
said Clara; "what, if my father, irritated by
your altered temper, should accuse, and wound
her gentle spirit by some rude charge of having
practised on your affections?"</p>

<p>This argument had its effect. Lionel paused,
and pressing Clara's hand, "Be ever thus," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he, "my guardian angel; read this letter to me,
I will be advised by you, and curb this impetuous
nature." Clara opened and read a formal
composition, announcing, with a good deal of
the <i>vieille cour</i> pomp, that the duke and all his
family were returned to the country, and anticipated
with pleasure a renewal of intercourse
with De Lacy castle. The concluding paragraph,
in form of a postscript, ran thus:</p>

<p>"I assure you that I have heard your son's
praises loudly rung since I had the good fortune
to see you last, and beg that you will bring
him with you, when you visit Beaumont."</p>

<p>"My father thinks largely of my vanity, it
would seem," said Lionel; "what has this complimentary
stuff to do with me? My head is not
likely to be made giddy with this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"The Duke has <i>daughters</i>, and my poor father's
eye, like that of the poet, 'in a fine frenzy-rolling,'
glances from earth to heaven, and
beholds the arms of Beaumont quartered with
those of De Lacy," replied Clara.</p>

<p>"Poetry, indeed! for he will be solely indebted
to his imagination for such a sight," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Lionel; "but I hope that he has more common
sense than to buoy himself up with hope so absurd,
upon the ground of this piece of frothy
ceremony."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Clara; and the event
proved that she was right. Lionel repaired to
his father's study, and found him pacing up and
down the room, with knit brow, and hands behind
his back, as if pondering some affair of
weighty issue.</p>

<p>"Good morrow, Sir; you wished, I think, to
see me here, and I am come to return the letter,
which kindly informs us that we may have the
notable privilege of leaving cards for the Duke
of Kingsbury."</p>

<p>"Cease with your idle sarcasms, Lionel," said
Sir Godfrey, "and sit down while you hear what
I have to say. I shall not dwell long upon the
past, nor sully an act of benevolence, by regretting
that mine induced me to give temporary
shelter to a houseless stranger. We are not
gifted with second sight, and must be sometimes
liable to err through the impossibility of foreseeing
consequences. This female adventurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
has shared our bounty, and I will not grudge
her the services which have been rendered, but
rejoice that she is gone; and as you were yourself
the person to suggest a reason fully sufficient
to account for her elopement from Lord
Marchdale's family, it is not my purpose, without
knowledge of the facts, to injure the character
of one who has probably no other reliance
for support. It is enough for me, that if
her noble host did really anticipate so horrible
a degradation as an attachment on the part of
their only son, towards the nameless foundling
of Hazlewood-moor; it is quite, I repeat, sufficient
for me to be assured that <i>you</i> possess
sense enough to enter into their feelings, and
perceive ground for such a change of manner
towards the object of their alarm, as to make
her either from honour or policy, resolve on removing
herself from Henbury."</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Lionel, "I pretend not to
combat your feelings, or those of Lord Marchdale,
if he concurs in your sentiments. I must
only declare against any participation in them
myself, and assure you that I consider Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Hautonville much more honoured by, than honouring
the lovely companion of his youth,
by any attachment which may subsist between
them."</p>

<p>"Silly, silly," said Sir Godfrey, with an impatient
tone; "I thought such folly had been
obsolete, and am sorry that a remnant of the
old leaven should be found under my roof. But
let Lord Marchdale and his son settle their own
affairs; <i>we</i> need not meddle in them. My
business with you at present is, I am happy to
say, of a far different kind, and I must, by way
of preface, inform you, my dear boy, that much
of the comfort which your mother and I venture
to look for during our future life, depends on
your coinciding with our views for your welfare.
To be brief, I have had it from undoubted authority,
that no event could be half so agreeable
to the Duke and Duchess of Kingsbury, as an
alliance with De Lacy castle, nor can I wonder
at this. The Duke has several children, and
small means to provide for them suitably in life,
while a union with my son would not only confer
wealth upon his house, but bring accession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
(Sir Godfrey drew up his shirt collar at both
sides, as he spoke) of those honours which every
sensible man desires to see added to his family
escutcheon. In point of birth-right, I thank
my stars, I do not yield to any dukedom in
Great Britain. Lady Jessie and Lady Emmiline
are charming persons; and I have, as I
said before, solid foundation for believing&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir, for interrupting you," said
Lionel; "I cannot allow you to proceed any
farther in a speculation at which my mind revolts.
I will endeavour to meet your wishes in
all reasonable requirements, and hope that I
shall never be tempted to bring dishonour on
your house; but I cannot consent to barter my
liberty for the indulgence of ambition, which,
forgive me for saying, I despise. Were man
created for no higher purpose than to serve as
a block on which to hang armorial emblazonments,
all his intellect, tastes, and affections are
an affair of cumbrous supererogation; but if
happiness be his aim and object, and if I cannot
find mine in the Heralds' Office, I should
certainly be a fool to seek it there. It could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
never occur to my imagination to interpret a
civil letter from the Duke, as you have done;
but believe me, that were his Grace of Kingsbury
to forget so far what is due to his own
pride and his daughter's delicacy, as to make an
unequivocal declaration in my favour, nothing
could possibly be so repugnant to my feelings as
to act upon such a hint."</p>

<p>Just as Sir Godfrey, whose angry eye boded
no very soft answer, was going to reply, the
footman announced his agent; and we may be
allowed to hope that the intelligence which he
had to communicate of having let some farms,
which were out of lease, at an advance of several
hundreds a year, had the good fortune to
act on the Baronet's temper like oil on the
troubled ocean's wave. Lionel was glad to adjourn;
and would have been well pleased had it
been <i>sine die</i>, but another conference was decreed
by Sir Godfrey, the result of which we
must leave in doubt to attend Zorilda to Drumcairn,
where she arrived without farther accident
or adventure.</p>

<p>As hills rise into height upon our approach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
from what in the distance had appeared a level
plain, so did a thousand scruples occur to her
mind in drawing near to the residence of her
friend, which till then had never distressed her.
Nothing but the journey thither had previously
perplexed our heroine in the thought of seeking
an asylum at Drumcairn; but she now questioned
her title to the boon. She had not announced
her purpose, and was an unexpected
visitor; perhaps might prove an unwelcome intruder.
She had few opportunities of corresponding
with Mrs. Gordon, who might have
forgotten her general invitation. Mr. Gordon,
too, might not desire her company. Oppressed
by such reflections, Zorilda ordered the postilion
to halt at a little village within a mile of Drumcairn;
and having alighted at a small neat quiet
inn, she wrote a note to Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>As soon as possible, after sending it off, she
was folded in the arms of that excellent woman,
who flew to greet the travellers, accompanied by
her husband, whose salutations were fully as
sincere, if not quite so rapturous, as those of his
partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The joy of this meeting was enhanced to Mrs.
Gordon by the uneasiness which she had felt
since a few lines from Lady Marchdale had
mentioned Zorilda's departure, and made rather
a haughty demand, whether she had not directed
her flight towards Aberdeenshire. Mrs. Gordon
had answered her sister's letter; and in
much earnestness had begged for farther particulars
of an event so unaccountable; but Lady
Marchdale was too selfishly absorbed by her
own cares to think of distant friends, and not
a line from Henbury, though repeatedly solicited,
had thrown light upon any thing which
was passing there. Both Mr. and Mrs. Gordon
had seen the newspaper paragraph to which
allusion was made at De Lacy castle; but as
they were only slightly acquainted with their
nephew's associates, and knew still less of his
habits of life, it so happened that they were
never struck with any application of the direful
circumstances which were related in the public
prints; and even had suspicion attached to the
story, the silence of the family at Henbury would
have completely banished it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>A few short hours put the friends mutually
in possession of all that either had to unfold.
Zorilda's history made the liveliest impression
on the kind hearts to which it was revealed; and
was followed by a solemn proffer of the most
affectionate adoption.</p>

<p>"Let me henceforward be the fond, though
imperfect, representative of that mother whom
you have lost, while I shall find in my beloved
Zoé such a daughter as I have often vainly
longed to press to my bosom," said Mrs. Gordon.
Zorilda's heart was too full for the lips
to speak, but she looked all that a sinking spirit
could express.</p>

<p>Though dreading pursuit, Zorilda had cherished
a secret hope, that on reaching Scotland
she might hear of Henbury; and learn what
effects had been produced there by her sudden
disappearance. This hope had greater influence
in supporting her exertions than she was aware
of, till disappointment crushed every energy of
her soul. She had reached the goal&mdash;she had
arrived at that haven of rest which had long
been the end and aim of her desires, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
experienced the inefficacy of external things to
restore peace to the lacerated heart. Nothing
which the tenderest feeling could suggest was
left undone, yet Zorilda drooped in spite of
every effort to repay the kindness of those
around her, by answering endeavours on her
part.</p>

<p>Drumcairn was the very sum and centre of
domestic bliss, and presented a scene of happiness
and concord, which seemed to realize the
beautiful vision of an earthly Elysium. The
landscape without was wildly picturesque; and
within, whatever was best, wisest, and most tasteful,
lent its aid to diversify the social resources.
How blessed could Zorilda have felt in such a
home; and what a gem would she have added
to its attractions were not the secret poison carrying
on its latent destruction, and gradually
undermining health and strength!</p>

<p>When the first agitation of meeting was over,
Mrs. Gordon invited her young friend to assist
her in the charitable labours which employed
much of her time. Zorilda learned, in these
pious exercises, that numbers of her fellow creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
were as miserable as herself. She soon
discovered that she was not the only houseless
orphan; but that thousands wept the bereavement
of parents, lovers, friends. Her mind at
last began to taste a heavenly pleasure in her
new occupations. To pour the balm of comfort
into the wounded spirit; to teach the young to
live, the sick and old to die, became her principal
delight; and her days were chiefly dedicated
to those duties of active goodness, in
which the selfishness of sorrow gradually gives
way to that peace which is ever sure to spring
from the pure source of practical religion. She
would often start from the recollections of past
time, and rush to employment from the stings of
memory.</p>

<p>Sometimes it grieved her that no word of
soothing friendship found its way to her from
De Lacy castle. A letter from Clara, to say
that her affection had not suffered diminution
from acquaintance with the events which she
confided to her knowledge would have been a
consolation; but Zorilda was making rapid progress
in the belief that there is no trial of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
which is not sent for some purpose of mercy, and
her beloved guide and instructress never failed
to improve every opportunity of tracing divine
goodness in the bitterest dispensations.</p>

<p>We will now leave the young saint pursuing
her celestial path, while we travel back to look
upon a very different scene.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I see with boding heart the near approach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an ill-starred, unblessed catastrophe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="p2">
<span class="smcap">Wallenstein.</span>
</p>


<p>The consternation of Lord and Lady Marchdale
was unutterable, when, on awakening in the
morning they learned that Lord Hautonville
had taken flight, leaving only a verbal message
to say, that sudden business had carried him to
London, from whence he hoped speedily to
return; and not a little was the vexation of this
abrupt departure aggravated in the minds of his
parents, by a persuasion that he had gone in
quest of Zorilda.</p>

<p>What rage, anxiety, and confusion of counsels,
succeeded, it is impossible to describe. At length,
after a stormy discussion, embittered by much
of mutual crimination, it was determined that
the whole family should pack up for the metropolis;
but as more elaborate preparations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
necessary for the elders than was required by
their son, some days elapsed before Henbury
was deserted by its inhabitants, who little thought
as they drove through the outer gate, that they
were destined to meet no more within its once
cheerful precincts.</p>

<p>On reaching Marchdale-house, they learned
that Lord Hautonville had been there, but was
gone: and all the information which his parents
could obtain respecting the object or motive of
his short stay and hurried departure, was from
the housekeeper, an utter stranger to the new
comers, and one who appeared by no means
overjoyed at the change. This woman reported
that the young lord seemed to be in the greatest
possible agitation, and that his sole care was to
find the Marquess of Turnstock, for whom he
made inquiry with vehement solicitude; but
finding that his lordship had set out for the
continent, Lord Hautonville left town immediately,
Mrs. Hobson could not tell with what
intent. It was some relief to the anxious parents
to learn that Lord Turnstock was the
object of their son's pursuit; and though it
mortified them that he should absent himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
without giving the slightest intimation of his
designs, and particularly at a period when his
presence was more than ever necessary at home,
they endeavoured to tranquillize their apprehensions,
by the flattering unction which they laid
to their hearts, that he had only followed his
friend into the country upon some scheme of
amusement.</p>

<p>Letters were dispatched to recall the truant,
and the Earl and his Countess were involved
directly in all the bustle of legal affairs and
visits of etiquette. When the time had expired
which ought in due course to have brought an
answer from Lord Hautonville, the arrival of
the post became a subject of restless inquiry,
but no letter arrived; and as it often happens
that the most obvious measures do not occur to
our minds <i>first</i> in the order of time, several
days elapsed before Lord Marchdale, applying
in the right place, heard from the Marquess's
banker that he was gone to Brussels.</p>

<p>During this interval Lord Hautonville, who
had taken his friend Col. Clapham along with
him, passed over to Ostend. On reaching
Brussels he was maddened almost to fury by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
finding that his enemy had gone upon an excursion,
and would not return for a few days.
Feeding on his meditated revenge, and suffering
imagination to supply all the facts which
were necessary to goad him to the rashest acts
of desperation, every moment appeared a century,
till Lord Turnstock unsuspectingly drove
to the door of the Hotel de Belle Vue, where he
was saluted, as soon as he alighted from his carriage,
by a challenge from his quondam ally, delivered
by the hands of Col. Clapham.</p>

<p>Lord Hautonville had had his suspicions so
convincingly corroborated by the answers which
he received to certain inquiries concerning the
Marquess, that he did not condescend to enter
into the slightest explanation relative to the nature
of the supposed insult for which he sought
revenge; and the latter, in utter ignorance of
the cause of offence, could not suppress an
involuntary smile, as he returned the challenge
to Colonel Clapham, and desired him to tell his
friend that it was not his custom to fight with
madmen.</p>

<p>An answer so irritating, heightened by the
sarcastic air with which it was accompanied, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
not calculated to appease; and as it lost nothing
in its transit (the second feeling himself now
nearly as much enraged as the principal), the
message was conveyed in such exaggerated colours,
as to deprive Lord Hautonville, for the
moment of all self-control. He seized his pistols,
rushed into the streets, arrived at the Hotel
de Belle Vue, darted into the room where
the Marquess was going to dine, and taking a
deliberate aim, shot him through the body,
without uttering a word. The Marquess fell,
the report of a pistol brought numbers of people
together; and before Colonel Clapham overtook
his friend, he was a prisoner. Surgical aid was
immediately obtained, the wounded man removed
to bed, his wounds examined, dressed,
and pronounced dangerous.</p>

<p>Returning reason made Lord Hautonville
speedily sensible of the awful situation in which
he had placed himself; rendered more horrible
by the assurance that he had no foundation for
his conjectures, and therefore not even the excuse
of injurious treatment for the dreadful act
which he had perpetrated.</p>

<p>Colonel Clapham's first care was to write to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
England, and apprise the unhappy parents of
their son's condition; advising the utmost secrecy
respecting the circumstances of this tragical
event, and their immediate presence in
Brussels, accompanied by whatever confidential
legal adviser they considered most likely to give
a favourable turn to the aspect of affairs.</p>

<p>The agonies of despair into which Lord and
Lady Marchdale were thrown by the dreadful
intelligence, almost deprived them of life, and
some days elapsed before the unfortunate pair
recovered sufficient bodily strength to undertake
their mournful expedition. This interval
was long enough to put them in possession of
the fact that Lord Hautonville's debts amounted
to a much larger sum than he had any prospect
of being enabled to repay; and several of them
revealed the truth that he was a determined
gambler, and lived amongst a set remarkable in
every way for habits of such dissipation as lead
to inevitable destruction.</p>

<p>But who shall attempt to pourtray the feelings
of the miserable culprit, when informed by
Colonel Clapham that his jealousy was groundless
as it had been vindictive; and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
marquess knew nothing whatsoever respecting
the elopement of Zorilda. Grief, contrition,
self-reproach, despair, took alternate possession
of his soul, and he would have laid down millions
to insure that life of which but a few hours
before he was resolved, at the probable sacrifice
of his own, on the cruel extermination.</p>

<p>The solitude of a prison is a powerful preacher
to the human soul! Conscience now called up
a grisly train of terrifying spectres; and a review
of the past rose in hideous contrast with
the fate which might have awaited him. Mr.
Playfair's counsels, illustrated in the lovely singleness
and purity of Zorilda's character, came
upon his memory and made him tremble. What
a difference between the beloved, the cherished
heir of a noble house, and the forlorn captive,
whose ignominious end was perhaps destined to
pay the forfeit of a murderous deed. The cold
dews of death stood now upon that brow on
which pride and pleasure were wont to keep
perpetual jubilee; and a livid paleness overspread
that cheek so lately animated by the
flush of enterprize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Of what avail were resolutions now? The
accounts from hour to hour, of the hapless victim's
condition, though sufficiently fluctuating
to keep the balance trembling between hope
and fear, afforded little comfort. If a momentary
ray cheered the prospect, it was extinguished
in the next instant. Amendment was
not progressive, and those transient gleams,
which were quenched successively in thicker
gloom, only added poignance to despair. In
the visions of horror which haunted the mind
of Algernon, thoughts of those afflicted parents
who were on their way to the scene of sorrow
and humiliation continually mingled; and, as if
the cup of grief could not be full unless it overflowed,
he was now enlightened, and could explain
Zorilda's disappearance. He was now
able to perceive in her secret departure, the
same noble self-denying spirit which had always
distinguished every action of her life; and to
curse the ungoverned passion which had hurried
him into irretrievable ruin. A sudden frenzy
would seize his frame, when scenes of early
mutual love, and childish innocence, glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
across memory in the prison's darksome solitude,
to torture his imagination&mdash;but more was still
to be endured.</p>

<p>The marquess preserved his senses throughout
the lingering agonies which he was doomed
to suffer&mdash;the most earnest supplication for pardon
on the one side, and assurance of forgiveness
on the other, were interchanged too late for
any purpose connected with this world's futurities.
The horrors of suspense, operating on irritable
nerves, and temper unsubdued, were too
powerful for successful conflict against them;
and Algernon Hartland, so lately the pride and
boast of a noble house, consumed by fever and
tortured by remorse, breathed his last, in the
same hour which brought Lord and Lady
Marchdale to the hotel which contained the
victim of their son's infuriate jealousy, apparently
languishing also on the confines of the
tomb.</p>

<p>The veil of Timanthes must be drawn over
feelings too terrible for description. The die
was cast. "Take me to the prison. I will
see my darling, and expire within his cell," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the wretched mother, who would not listen to
any attempt at dissuading her from the dreadful
purpose of visiting the remains of her son.
Colonel Clapham conducted her, and with preternatural
firmness she hastened forward; but
the sight which burst upon her senses, when
she reached the dreary chamber in which he
lay, was the last on which her tearless eyes ever
rested. The mother's heart had received its
death dart, and her whole soul appeared to undergo
a sudden change. Not a cry escaped
her. Kneeling calmly down by the bed-side,
and pressing to her bosom the clay-cold hand
of Algernon her beloved&mdash;once "beautiful and
brave"&mdash;her countenance assumed an unwonted
expression of heavenly peace. Her husband
stood with folded arms, behind her, and groaned
heavily. She looked round, and taking his
hand also, laid it upon that of her departed
child; then raising her eyes, she exclaimed with
fervor, "Lord forgive me&mdash;Thy will be done!"
After uttering which word, one short convulsive
sigh set the spirit free.</p>

<p>Stunned and transfixed, the miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
survivor bent over the bed of death, like one who
had been petrified in that attitude, and scarcely
preserved consciousness of the scene which surrounded
him. At this awful moment, Mr.
Playfair entered the chamber. That excellent
man had accidentally met with a friend who
prevailed on him to alter his original design of
proceeding directly to Switzerland, and visit
first the far-famed plain of Waterloo. No
sooner had he arrived at Brussels, than the fearful
tale which was in every mouth, met
his ear. He quickly recognised the <i>dramatis
personæ</i> in this horrible tragedy, and hastened
to inform himself of all its particulars. The
case admitted of no earthly comfort, and he
wept with heartfelt bitterness over the misfortunes
of those unhappy parents whom he followed
to the prison.</p>

<p>"Vain titles of worldly greatness! how little
is it in your power to confer happiness!" ejaculated
this true friend, as he hastened after the
sufferers. What a spectacle presented itself
when he reached the gloomy pile, and gained
the dismal scene of death just in time to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the pious aspiration which bore a mother's spirit
to the eternal world! He knelt, and prayed
aloud for heaven's mercy on him who stood, like
the scathed oak of the forest, a sad monument
of solitary existence, when the pelting of the
pitiless storm has levelled all things else in desolation
and destruction at its feet.</p>

<p>Lord Marchdale was removed insensible
from the prison, and a shock of paralysis for a
time shed the poppies of oblivion over his senses,
and spared him for more tranquil days to come.
Colonel Clapham, who was deeply affected, and
began to reproach himself as the principal actor
in the late catastrophe, now delivered into Mr.
Playfair's hands two letters with which his poor
friend had entrusted him the day before his
death, when he felt his last hour drawing near.
One was addressed to his parents, the other to
Zorilda; and he desired that they might be
safely conveyed when he should be no more.</p>

<p>"You will be the fittest medium for the performance
of this charge. How can I appear
again in the presence of those from whom I
might have averted the calamity which bows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
them broken-hearted to the earth? Oh, Mr.
Playfair, had I not fanned the flame, which I
might at least have endeavoured to extinguish;
had I not used all my influence to provoke and
aggravate the feelings of my poor friend, instead
of trying to assuage them, how different might
not have been the result? But I am punished
as I deserve. His untimely end is my work,
and I shall never cease during my life, to be
haunted by his dying image, when he called
upon the grim tyrant to terminate his misery,
and relieve him from the anguish of anticipating
an ignominious end."</p>

<p>Mr. Playfair did not fail to improve the feeling
which had been awakened in Colonel Clapham's
mind, not by laying flattering unction to
his criminal conduct, but by encouraging such
repentance for the past as should effectually
guard, during the remainder of his life against
its recurrence. While he continued to take
advantage of the opportunity to impress wholesome
truths upon a softened heart, a message
was brought from Lord Turnstock's
apartment to say that the physicians who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
just been holding consultation, were of opinion
that a favourable crisis had taken place in the
night; and it was the earnest desire of the marquess
to have the joyful tidings communicated,
without a moment's delay, to the prisoner.
What indescribable rapture would the intelligence
have imparted a little week before! Then
might it have poured the balsam of returning
health into the fevered veins&mdash;the balm of stillness
into the agitated breast&mdash;and whispered
peace to the withered spirit; but it came not
till the dull cold ear was deaf to the voice of the
charmer&mdash;till the heart had ceased to beat, and
the weary pulses to flutter.</p>

<p>The mother and her son were laid in the same
grave, and Mr. Playfair and Colonel Clapham
attended the sad procession as chief mourners.
It was a sight which struck upon all who witnessed
it, and was not soon forgotten. Lord
Marchdale continued in a doubtful state, and
some time elapsed ere it was considered safe to
move him. During this interval the favourable
change in Lord Turnstock's condition was sufficiently
confirmed to admit of his being visited
by Colonel Clapham, who gradually prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
his mind for the dreadful events which had occurred.
Informed, at length, of the whole
truth, he expressed an eager desire to see Mr.
Playfair, who obeyed the summons with readiness,
anxious on his part to turn present circumstances
to account, and work a salutary impression
on him, who of all people living had
exercised the most destructive influence on the
character of the departed.</p>

<p>The meeting was solemn and affecting.
Though death seemed no longer in immediate
prospect, the marquess was assured by his medical
attendants that nothing short of the most
patient temperance and long continued caution,
could afford the slightest hope of restoration,
and he therefore saw before him so much of uncertainty
in the prospect as to furnish scope for
deep reflection.</p>

<p>It occurred to Mr. Playfair, that no language
which he could possibly employ, would be so
efficacious in giving a right turn to meditation,
as the last words of one who had lived long
enough to retract every principle on which his
actions had been governed, and he therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
determined on seizing an opportunity which
could never return, of making Algernon speak
from the tomb. Well assured that those to
whom the letters which he possessed were addressed,
would approve such use of their contents,
he drew the packet which was unsealed
from his bosom, and read as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
"<small>TO THE EARL AND COUNTESS OF MARCHDALE</small>.
</p>

<p>"Alas! my parents; my soul sickens as I
trace these empty titles, which seem but 'unreal
mockery' when applied to you. 'How are the
mighty fallen!' Oh! my father, my poor
mother&mdash;here is the fulfilment of your prophetic
vision. Here, in this damp and chilly
cell, is the end of all your ambition. I feel as
if you were now on your way to this place, but
you will come too late. The vapour is dissolved,
the bubble bursts; the halter and the
block would present the only alternative for
your unhappy son were life prolonged; but
Heaven has heard the captive's prayer, and
death approaches with friendly speed to save
you from shame, and restrain the hand of Algernon
from self-destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horrible idea! yet it might have been so.
The same ungovernable passions which raised
the murderous blow against another's existence,
might have urged to suicide under increasing
temptation. Weep not for him who is taken
from evil to come. My parents! had you been
less aspiring, had you known that true happiness,
but&mdash;forbear, my pen!&mdash;I leave no brethren
to benefit by my dying counsels. My own
impetuous temper, my own devouring selfishness,
have been my bane. Try to forget that I
have ever been. Recall that angel whom you
have banished; she will speak peace to your
troubled souls. Farewell, my dear father; and
oh, my mother, may Heaven support you in
this season of trial! prays your expiring</p>

<p class= "right">"<span class="smcap">Algernon</span>"
</p>

<p class="center">
"<small>TO ZORILDA</small>.
</p>

<p>"First and last beloved, I dedicate to you
this solemn pause between time and eternity.
Life is ebbing fast. Oh! Zorilda, I die, and
die for you. However unworthy of your regard,
however wandering and irregular my
course, you have still been the polar star<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
towards which my unsettled spirit ever returned,
and no scheme for future happiness ever occupied
my thoughts, of which you were not the
soul and centre. While living in sin, I dreamed
of a virtuous hereafter, when guided by you, I
should reform and taste of quiet bliss.</p>

<p>"Arrogant delusion! I leaned presumptuously
on that love which I was daily forfeiting,
and dared to believe that Zorilda, whose soul
was all purity, would still bestow her affection
on one who had ceased to merit it. Alas! I
know that you love me no longer. Why should
I repine in this sad hour? No, while life continued,
I could ill endure to relinquish the hold
which I once possessed on that dear heart, and
my selfish endeavour to bind you by a vow to
refuse all besides, that of which I was myself
undeserving, was justly punished by your refusal.</p>

<p>"Zorilda, beloved Zorilda! I feel my heart
new opened, I see with other eyes, and despise
the thing I have been; resolution can now avail
me nothing in this world; but He who sees my
tears of contrite humiliation, will hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
suppliant's prayer, even in the eleventh hour.
Farewell! If the memory of our fond attachment
in happy youthful days, may shed kind
influence on a last request, console I entreat
you those unfortunate beings who are soon
to be left childless. Bid them not grieve
for me. I have requited their affection with
ingratitude, and leave them nothing in my
bereavement but a hollow sounding name,
like those gorgeous plumes which wave their
feathered honours on the hearse to mock the
dead. Oh! 'had I served my God with half
the zeal' that ministered to my guilty pleasures!
but the past is buried with the years beyond the
flood. I have your prayers, I know I have, unworthy
as I am, and Zorilda's prayers will reach
the throne of mercy.</p>

<p>"My sand is nearly run. The king of terrors
beckons to me. A little while, a few brief
moments, and I shall awake in the invisible
world, from whose bourne none hath ever returned
to unfold its mysteries. Strength fails.
Cold dews creep over my frame. Think of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sometimes. First and last beloved, farewell for
ever."</p>

<p>When Mr. Playfair ceased to read, he found
Lord Turnstock drowned in tears. His own
flowed plenteously; and, taking the sick man's
hand, "My Lord," said he, "let us not be
ashamed, and call this weakness. There are
tears which refresh the soul like dews of heaven.
May yours be of this blessed nature! May you
expiate past error, by seeking your future portion
in a new course; and may our dear departed
Hartland be the Mentor of your youth;
the guide of your pilgrimage; the beacon of
your way!"</p>

<p>"Will you henceforward be my friend?" answered
the Marquess, with deep emotion. "I
have learned a lesson, but impressions wear
away, and vows made in pain are speedily forgotten.
Let me be your pupil; direct me;
warn me; counsel me."</p>

<p>The bond was sealed. Lord Marchdale was
pronounced capable of undertaking a journey;
and Mr. Playfair, who had surrendered all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
own plans to devote himself to the purposes of
benevolence, accompanied the poor solitary Earl
to England; but his chief concern was for Zorilda.
"How shall I break these fatal tidings,
without endangering her life?" was a question
continually present to the mind of her friend.</p>

<p>The travellers arrived at Henbury, and Mr.
Playfair felt as a man of humane and tender
feeling would naturally do, in placing his charge
in that whilom abode of quiet cheerfulness,
where its unfortunate master had long enjoyed
the happiness of domestic peace in private life,
under the care of an old servant, who had
passed her youthful days in his family. Lord
Marchdale was spared such anguish, as more
acute sensibility could not have survived by the
nature of his malady. Naturally phlegmatic,
disease now rendered him more than ordinarily
torpid; and he used to forget at times not only
the extent of his deprivation, but the manner.
At such moments it was affecting to hear him
address his wife and son as if they were present,
or speak of them as if he expected their return
from a ride or a walk. Influenced, too, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
necromancy of association, he never passed by a
shrub or flower, which had been planted by Zorilda's
hand, without muttering the name of
Zoé.</p>

<p>When Mr. Playfair had made all necessary
arrangement for the bodily comfort of the invalid,
he set out for Scotland, meditating sorrowfully
as he proceeded, on the afflicting dispensations
which it was his painful task to communicate
at Drumcairn. Arrived at the same village
where Zorilda had paused to consider of the reception
which she was likely to receive, he
wrote to Mr. Gordon, requesting a private interview
at the inn. The dreadful particulars
were soon unfolded; and Mr. Playfair discovered
that his tale of woe was not altogether
unexpected. Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had so repeatedly
seen paragraphs in the public prints,
touching on late events at Brussells with more
or less obscurity, that their attention was
at length awakened to some fancied coincidences
with the Henbury family, and anxiety
was daily on the increase, from Lady Marchdale's
unusual silence. Her sister had written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
over and over entreating a letter, but not a line
was received in reply.</p>

<p>The extreme delicacy of Zorilda's health
made all excitement hazardous; and though she
secretly pined with solicitude to be informed of
all that passed in her absence, she could not
bear to make inquiry, and trusted to a voluntary
mention of the next intelligence which might
arrive, trying to force her mind into tranquillity,
but in vain. Her cheek sometimes glowed with
momentary bloom, and her eyes sparkled with
a transient ray of light and brilliancy; but it
was fever which lighted up these evanescent
fires, consuming as they were vivid.</p>

<p>Her kind friends, who watched her tender
frame with parental vigilance, and perceived the
silent progress of the destroying angel, resolved
on avoiding to impart their own apprehensions,
or communicate the suspicions which began to
alarm them, to Zorilda, who, in addition to her
too evidently declining health, "has now to sustain,"
said Mr. Gordon, "a trying scene, which
as yet she has neither had strength nor fortitude
to encounter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Within the last two days," continued he,
"she has received a disclosure of the deepest
interest from the rich and powerful Earl of
Pierrepoint, who turns out to be no other than
Zorilda's father. I have brought his letter in
my pocket, knowing how affectionately you participate
in the concerns of our dear child."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon then read as follows:</p>

<p>"Zorilda, these lines come from a parent's
hand. Will you receive them with feeling answering
to that which now sues for your forgiveness,
and dictates a request that you will name
the earliest moment for an interview with one
for whom you have had little reason to entertain
any sentiment save that of aversion. Since we
last met, when an involuntary exclamation on
my part proclaimed the relation subsisting between
you and me, I have lost an amiable and
high-born partner, who, after the marriage of
my two daughters, now advantageously settled,
was the only remaining bar to my acknowledgment
of you. Had I claimed you before, I
must have revealed a part of my early history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
which might have injured others without benefiting
you.</p>

<p>"Let me now taste the blessing of offering
such expiation as is yet in my power, to the
manes of that angel who was your mother. You
will not withhold your aid in restoring the memory
of her whose portrait you bear, whose
living image you are, to the rights and privileges
of a wife and mother, which can only be accomplished
by your returning to the protection of
your father's house, and assuming his name. In
the eye of Heaven, as well as according to an
accredited form of Christian ritual, my marriage,
of which you are the sole pledge, was duly solemnized,
and wanted only such circumstances
to give it legality, as I basely took advantage of,
to desert the wife of my bosom, and the child of
my hopes. Urged to the unnatural deed by the
unrelenting voice of worldly ambition, I lent
myself to the views of family aggrandisement,
and have been wretched all my life. United to
another before the death of her whom I shall
never cease to mourn, I could not adopt you as
my legitimate offspring, without invalidating my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
second engagement; and to have brought you
forward as <i>less</i> than my lawful progeny, would
have but added fresh insult to the wrongs which
you had already experienced at my hands.</p>

<p>"Zorilda, beloved child, a father supplicates
forgiveness at your feet. Will you refuse pardon
to such a petitioner? I have sought you at
De Lacy castle, and sought you as my daughter.
If my penetration do not greatly err, there is
one of that family to whom you are an object of
no common interest. Should my suspicions prove
correct, to what joy may I not yet look forward?
I have already obtained my sovereign's permission
to add a title to your name; and twenty
thousand pounds are ready for my dear girl,
when I may be called upon to bestow the hand
of Lady Zorilda Fitzhugh on Lionel Cecil, the
man in all England most worthy of her heart.</p>

<p>"Return me one line by the messenger, and
say when you will see your</p>

<p class= "right">
"<span class="smcap">Father</span>."
</p>

<p>"This letter," said Mr. Gordon, "was immediately
followed by one of the most enraptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
congratulations from Miss Cecil, who it
appears has been hitherto obliged to neglect
her friend in compliance with Sir Godfrey's
commands. What a metamorphosis will not
worldly consideration effect! The despised,
the slighted Zorilda receives homage now from
the proudest pair in Great Britain. Sir Godfrey
and Lady Cecil condescend to add their testimony
to the merits of her who was so lately
shaken from their presence as unworthy of the
least regard: and I agree with Lord Pierrepoint
in foreseeing that ere long an alliance will be
solicited. Oh; that I might live to witness a
union which could not fail of being blessed!
But what a tale have you to impart! Alas, Zorilda!&mdash;and
my poor Eugenia too. However
dissimilar the character of Lady Marchdale and
my wife, a sister and a nephew are not to be
relinquished without a cruel pang, in this case
pointed with tenfold acuteness from the awful
manner of their death. Come, we have a dreadful
duty to perform, and must commence the task."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon, who had long anticipated some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
unknown ill, was gradually informed of the
terrible truth. Horror and astonishment at
first forbid the relief of tears, and sent a frightful
tremor through her frame; but tenderer
feelings at length found vent, and a burst of
natural sorrow came to her aid, and eased the
suffocating oppression of her heart. Too habitually
thoughtful of others' woe to indulge her
own exclusively, this excellent woman after a
short silence exclaimed, "Oh! may I join in
the pious prayer of my dear departed sister,
and say from the deep of my heart, 'Thy will
be done!' This blow will fall heavily on my
poor Zoé. It is to her that we should principally
direct our attention, and as her father is
to be here to-morrow, my counsel is to delay
breaking this intelligence to her till after that
so much dreaded interview. In the mean time
I will talk to her of my own fears and ominous
forebodings."</p>

<p>This advice was approved, and Mrs. Gordon
subdued her own feelings sufficiently to visit
Zorilda's bed-chamber, in which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
requested permission to remain all day, with calmness,
and even an appearance of tender cheerfulness,
while she endeavoured to strengthen
a mind which had so much in prospect to
endure.</p>

<p>"You must give a filial welcome to your
father, my love, and bless the Almighty, who has
sent such a host of kindness and protection in
an hour of greatest need. He was beloved by
the mother whose loss you deplore, and if the
temptations of wealth and power were too
strong for his wavering virtue to conquer, remember
that he is now making all the reparation
which such a case as yours will admit, and
your duty is not only to receive the penitent
with full pardon, but open your heart to the
gracious influence of parental affection."</p>

<p>"It is not the creature's part to murmur, I
know, dearest friend," answered Zorilda; "but
so mysteriously woven is the web of my fate,
that I am not allowed to <i>see and believe</i>, but
<i>faith</i> is continually called upon, and much as I
desire to stand firmly in the optimist's creed,
which you are always enforcing, I find my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
rebellious spirit too frequently resisting conviction.
I did indeed perceive how mercifully was this
blessed asylum opened to me; when obliged to
leave De Lacy castle I could not return to the
home of my youth; but how can I rejoice now
in any event which is likely to remove me from
you and this peaceful retreat? How am I to
bear the burthen of a sick and sorrowful soul in
a world of gay smiles, enter upon a new sphere
for which I am ill suited, encounter strangers
whom I can never love, and give up those employments
in which, by being suffered to do
some little good, I learn submission to my own
misfortunes? How can I leave this abode of
rest, and cease to hear your dear voice? How
shall I mingle in the scenes of what the world
calls pleasure, with a breaking heart and failing
health; or learn the joyless task of dressing my
poor face in artificial gladness, while the asp is
feeding on my life-blood? I have tried to pray,
but I can only weep."</p>

<p>"Child of my adoption," answered Zorilda's
sweet comforter, "be still and wait events. Is
it nothing that your mother's fame is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
out before mankind like 'unsmutched snow?'
Nothing that the haughty souls of De Lacy
yield to evidence, and recognise the daughter of
proud Pierrepoint in the houseless adventurer,
the <i>wandering</i> gipsey? Is there no balm in Clara's
friendship, lately sealed, and now allowed to flow
towards you?&mdash;no soothing in the still tenderer
accents of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am ungrateful, hard, unthankful, I know
I am, for many goods; yet could you look into
this breast, and see all that passes there, you would
pity more than censure me," replied Zorilda.</p>

<p>"And will that Being, whose penetrating
glance reads the inmost soul, who knows all our
frailty, all our weakness, pity less than I should
do? Believe it not. You will not be tried beyond
the bounds of mercy, though you know
not how much is still to be endured. My mind
misgives me, and this long silence of my sister's
fills me with vague, yet sad prognostics; I dread
the arrival of letters, and feel my mind almost
superstitiously inclined to evil augury."</p>

<p>"How unlike you!" said Zorilda, "If <i>you</i>
are scared by omens and portents, what wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
that <i>I</i> should tremble; dearest friend, tell me
your fears."</p>

<p>"They have no shape," answered Mrs. Gordon,
"but come not the less affrightingly because
they are undefined. When I contemplate
the materials of which my family are composed,
have I not continual reason to dread the consequences
of ungoverned passion, self indulgence,
and pride, now inflated by the prosperous gales
of fortune? What may I not apprehend as the
result of Algernon's violent temper, unaccustomed
to restraint, and now let loose to tyrannize
with wider scope, subduing all things to his
purposes? My poor sister, too, so blind in her
attachments, so precipitate in her aversions,
so little calculated for the enlarged sphere of
action to which she is called, so ill prepared
to meet with disappointment, so soured by late
occurrences; what comfort should I have in considering
the elevation of those for whom I am
so deeply interested, to a station which will only
furnish increased temptation to err, and render
every fault and failing more conspicuous, were
it not for my firm trust in Him who rules our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
destinies, and who alone is acquainted with the
issue of events, after which we vainly strain our
short sighted organs?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me," replied Zorilda, "for the indulgence
of my morbid discontent. 'I will
arise and go to my father,' I will try to <i>follow</i>,
not presumptuously <i>lead</i>, the ordinances of
Providence; you shall not find me deaf to your
instructions. Dispose of me. The tide of
strength is ebbing in my veins, and perhaps the
mind partakes of the body's weakness, for I was
not always thus, but in all things I will endeavour
to obey your counsels; guide, direct me;
tell me all that I shall say and do in this dread
hour of meeting; yet if my father should prove
an austere man, I am afraid that it will little
avail me to con over my lesson."</p>

<p>Zorilda knew nothing of Mr. Playfair's arrival,
and it was resolved to conceal his presence
from her till after Lord Pierrepoint's visit.</p>

<p>The appointed hour drew near, and the flush
of anxiety had lighted up that cheek on which
the lily had lately begun to usurp the rose's
dominion, and the blending of sorrow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
timid solicitude, imparted the most angelic expression
to the countenance of her who now,
with beating heart, heard her father's carriage
wheels approach the door.</p>

<p>Lord Pierrepoint's exterior was highly favourable;
tall, graceful, and still in the meridian
of life, there was something singularly prepossessing
in his appearance. To fine features,
was added that charm of polished refinement
without which no beauty can be attractive, and
accompanied by which, no physiognomy can be
destitute of power to please. A melodious
voice, and insinuating gentleness of manner,
finished the impression which Lord Pierrepoint's
first <i>abord</i> never failed to make upon
strangers, but who shall attempt to describe the
effect of such a union of qualities in delightful
contrast with all that her fears had suggested,
on the tender heart of his lovely daughter?
The scene of such a meeting can only be represented
in the imagination. Feelings so electric,
transitions so rapid, silence so eloquent, may
be felt, but not pourtrayed.</p>

<p>Locked in each other's arms, one moment's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
embrace seemed to annihilate an age of doubt,
and banish from Zorilda's bosom every sentiment
except that of filial love and admiration;
while the father hung spell-bound over his treasure.
Drawing her close to his breast, and
then receding, as if</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"&mdash;&mdash;to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If such a bliss indeed were true,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he continued to clasp her again and again to
his heart in silent rapture.</p>

<p>When the first strong instinctive emotions of
nature had in some degree subsided, Lord
Pierrepoint remarked, with much uneasiness,
the delicacy of his daughter's complexion, which
underwent a thousand aspects, mutable as the
dolphin tints or the sun's varying hues upon
the snows of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>"I must lose no time in snatching my darling,"
said the fond parent, "from this northern
climate. My Zorilda shall invoke the warmer
beams and softer breezes of an Italian sky. We
will prepare immediately for the voyage."</p>

<p>A deep hectic blush overspread Zorilda's face,
as thoughts of leaving Drumcairn flashed across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
her mind; but dreading to hurt her father's
feelings, by seeming averse to any scheme proposed
by his affection, she made no reply, except
by a faint smile, like that transient glow
which glances hastily through the misty curtain
on the grey mountain's side, and is followed by
a thicker veil, gathering as if to repel the bright
intrusion. But associations of another kind
arose in Lord Pierrepoint's mind, and pressing
his daughter's hand, he added, "I do not mean
to hurry you, my love. You are, I grieve to
see, not equal to any great exertion. Farewell,
dearest, I will return to-morrow, and we will
then consult upon the answer which you wish
me to give to Sir Godfrey Cecil."</p>

<p>So saying, he put a letter, of which the seal
was broken, upon the table, kissed his dear
girl's alabaster forehead, and hastened out of
the room.</p>

<p>"All powerful force of nature?" exclaimed
Zorilda, as she strained her eyes towards the
door which had closed upon her father, "who
could have believed this miracle? My heart
follows him, and echoes every retiring footstep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Is this the formidable being whose anticipated
presence banished sleep from my eyelids, whose
dreaded voice arrested every pulse, while yet it
sounded only in the ear of fancy? What a
transformation in an instant of time! I can
scarcely believe in my own identity, as I reckon
the hours till his return. Poor Sir Godfrey!
Here is the world&mdash;the cold heartless world,
which encumbers with help when there is no
farther need of assistance. What have we here?
No doubt a complimentary address. Perchance
an invitation to De Lacy castle&mdash;but I must
not forget that De Lacy's walls afforded me
kind refuge in an hour of adversity." Zorilda
sighed, as she slowly unfolded the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<small>MY DEAR LORD</small>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Amongst the numberless congratulations
which your Lordship may expect to receive on
the joyful event of reunion with your charming
daughter, none more sincere can be offered to
your acceptance, than I have now the honour
to present from De Lacy castle. We have the
good fortune here to be acquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
perfections which it is your Lordship's happy
lot to possess in the Lady Zorilda Fitzhugh;
and are therefore enabled to judge of your feelings
in receiving such a child to your bosom,
and restoring her to that exalted station in society
which will henceforward be adorned by
her talents and virtue. Lady Cecil and I have
often said of our distinguished guest, that such
a noble bearing bespoke high birth, and we are
not mistaken.</p>

<p>"It will not surprise your Lordship to learn
that younger eyes have been fascinated, and
hearts impressed by attractions which even the
aged cannot behold unmoved. You know my
son's pretensions, and if you think them worthy
of alliance with your Lordship's house, nothing
shall be wanting on my part to facilitate an
event so desirable to me as a union between our
families. I have long been aware of my son's
deep admiration of the Lady Zorilda, but so entirely
averse is he to revealing his sentiments at
the <i>present</i> juncture, that I risk his displeasure
in making an avowal to which I am urged by
the high sense that I entertain of those qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
which must render your daughter an
object of universal competition.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be, my Lord, your
Lordship's sincere friend, and most obedient
humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Godfrey Cecil</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"Pompous treachery!" exclaimed Zorilda,
as she folded the letter. "How grateful to his
ear the tinkling bell of Ladyship, appended to
this</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<small>&mdash;&mdash;Jonah's Gourd</small>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>An overnight creation of court favour</small>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>With which an undistinguishable case</small><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>Makes baron, or makes prince</small>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I hate this greedy haste which, fearful of
forestalment, thus violates all delicacy, and would
compromise the feelings of his pure and nobleminded
son, to compass his proud ends&mdash;but we
are going to Italy. Perhaps, too, this is for
the best. If I must leave dear Drumcairn, at
least it will be some recompense that I shall
quit these harpies, who, like Sir Godfrey, hover
round the well spread board, and force their
unneeded praise where fortune smiles."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon's entrance interrupted this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
soliloquy. "I left you, my dear one, to meet
your trial alone, because my presence might
have embarrassed your father."</p>

<p>"Yes he <i>is</i> my father. I feel the sacred bond
drawn tight across my heart, which almost beat
itself to death, like a poor bird against its prison
wires, in terror of his approach. You say truly,
my monitress, that we are for ever prone to take
trouble at interest. Aye, and usurious interest
too&mdash;we raise ghosts and then wonder that they
haunt us. But my dear father talks of Italy,
and thinks that her classic shores bear healing
on their gales. Alas! he knows not how deep
the mine&mdash;how industrious the sappers. The
'sweet South' can do nought for me. No
breeze, however balmy, 'can minister unto the
mind diseased.' I have a longer journey before
me than to Nice or Pisa."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon had hitherto controlled her
feelings, but, overcome by the prophetic melancholy
which accompanied the last words of Zorilda,
she burst into tears, and, covering her
face with her hands, remained for some time
unable to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kindest, dearest friend," said Zorilda, "I
meant only to familiarize your mind to what I
feel must come to pass ere long&mdash;but I am
always doing wrong. The idea of death is so
welcome to me that I forget its sorrowful effect
on others, and have grieved my best and dearest
Mrs. Gordon. Oh think no more of my Cassandra
propensities; let us speak of something
else. I did not hear my father's carriage drive
from your door. Surely he cannot still be
here?"</p>

<p>"He is still here, my Zorilda, and listening to
a tale of woe which concerns us all; but my
child, Heaven has sent you support in this dear
and newly found relation. May you rest on him
as on a pillar of strength, and be enabled to
stand firm under divine assistance! I too have
been a Cassandra, but you must hear the dismal
story from other lips. I cannot tell it to you."</p>

<p>"You have given me a clue," said Zorilda,
who turned as pale as ashes, "which too fatally
directs my imagination, though not perhaps
through every winding of the labyrinth. Speak,
oh speak! you need not fear to trust me; I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
bear to hear. Yes, I can bear to hear even
that Algernon&mdash;my once loved&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words which Zorilda would have uttered
died upon her lips, and she fell senseless at Mrs.
Gordon's feet.</p>

<p>When she recovered recollection, she found
herself laid on a sofa, while Mr. Playfair kneeled
at her side, invoking heavenly mercy in her
behalf. He had put every one out of the room,
and took upon himself the task of preparing her
for a full disclosure; but Zorilda's quick eye
and mind anticipated the conclusion, and she
was in possession of the whole ere it was designed
that she should be informed of more than
half the direful narrative.</p>

<p>Mr. Playfair did not give Algernon's letter
till after imagination was so wrought upon, that
even that dreadful document by realizing the
horrors of the scene which it exhibited, prevented
reason from deserting her throne to
wander irretrievably into the wild regions of
maniac desolation.</p>

<p>"It is done!" said Zorilda; "it is finished.
Lord, thou wouldst have my whole heart, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
is thine! 'Whom have I in heaven but thee,
and whom do I desire on earth beside thee.' I
can say this now&mdash;Hah! killed by <i>his</i> hand!
a murderer! But he is pardoned. Oh say not
that forgiveness is impossible!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<small>Between the death-deed and the ground</small><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>He mercy sought and mercy found</small>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tell me not that he did not repent the act."</p>

<p>A violent shuddering came over her whole
frame, from which suddenly starting up, she
gazed round the room, and asked for Mrs. Gordon,
who waited but the slightest movement in
the apartment to open the door, and heedless of
her own affliction, fly to the aid of sorrow yet
greater than that which she suffered.</p>

<p>But there was now no longer any apparent
weakness to combat&mdash;no excess of feeling to
assuage&mdash;all was still.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Zorilda, in a firm voice,
as she held her hand to Mrs. Gordon, "help me
to shake off this lethargy. God has given me
duties to perform. I must no longer be a useless
torpid thing. Where is my father?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Pierrepoint had lingered to wait the
event, and now stole softly into his daughter's
apartment. Surprised and delighted by her unexpected
fortitude, he determined to indulge every
wish which she might express, in the hope by
doing so to restore her soon to a sufficient measure
of health and tranquillity for the undertaking
which he meditated. "A warm climate
will strengthen, and a gradual introduction to
society, the charms of which are unknown to
her, will do the rest," said he in a whisper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon shook her head, but did not
contradict these visions of hope.</p>

<p>"My father will not refuse his child's request,"
said Zorilda, who raised her beautiful
eyes as he drew near the couch on which she
leaned; "he will conduct me to the home of
my youth. I have another father there, who
needs my consolation. Shall I not offer him all
that I have to bestow?"</p>

<p>"My Zorilda shall do every thing that may
contribute to her peace," answered Lord Pierrepoint.
"I will give immediate orders for the
journey."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>A gleam of short-lived irradiation shot across
the pale cheek of Zorilda, who pressed her parent's
hand in mute acknowledgment of his
goodness, but Mrs. Gordon interposed.</p>

<p>"My Zorilda," said she, "has other claims
upon her heart, and she will not neglect to
fulfil them. <i>Something</i> is due to her poor
friends at Drumcairn, and she will not desert
them in this moment of heaviness. I too must
share with her the task of watching and comforting
my poor brother. Why not bring him
here? The change of scene will assist our cares
for him, and my Zoé will recover faster in the
repose of this chamber than in the excitement of
a journey, for the fatigues of which she is not
strong enough at present."</p>

<p>Zorilda sighed in silence, when she perceived
by the expression of her father's countenance
how much he preferred this arrangement to her
plan. Mr. Playfair warmly seconded the measure
proposed by Mrs. Gordon, and offered to
attend Lord Pierrepoint on the following day.
They commenced their route at an early hour,
promising to return as quickly as circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
would admit; bringing their invalid charge
along with them to Scotland.</p>

<p>Zorilda's fervid bloom and tearless eye would
have led an ignorant observer to believe that
some secret source of joy poured the soft springs
of consolation over her withered spirit, and that
hope still fluttered in the distance. Hope and
faith were indeed whispering peace, but they
were not of this world; they were celestial
visitants, and Mrs. Gordon was not deceived.
Zorilda had forced her friend to bed, and entreated
to be left in solitude herself. On entering
her room in the morning, Mrs. Gordon,
who had not slept, found her beloved adopted
child already up, her head reclining on her
hand, papers and writing implements scattered
around.</p>

<p>"My mother," said she, "I have been busy
making my will. You must take care of my
poor pensioners. You will be my almoner.
You know that I have a little fortune in bank.
I am setting my house in order, and long to be
gone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon could not reply. Zorilda rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and threw her arms affectionately round the
neck of her who was truly a mother to her in
tenderness. "I will not afflict you any more,"
said she, "by touching on these subjects which
distress you. Yet were you to know how sweet
are the thoughts of death, you would not grieve.
It was you too who first imparted to my soul
that strength in which I am now permitted to
pass through the dark valley; you taught me
to lean on the staff which is now sustaining my
footsteps: and will you repent you of the good
you have performed, and mourn over the happy
work which you have accomplished?</p>

<p>"I cannot tell how it is, but I feel assured
that the conflict will speedily be ended. How
simple, how beautiful is the religion which
teaches how to die! and how little does it resemble
the eloquent declamations, the fine spun
arguments, the perplexing subtleties, with which
we puzzle comprehension and estrange the
affections, while 'redolent of life' we waste our
intellectual prime in the labyrinths of metaphysical
lore, and <i>talk</i> ourselves far away from
God. My mother, I am about to depart, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
shall soon be removed beyond the confines of
sense. Pray for me, not that I should tarry
here, but be received amidst the countless millions
of the blessed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon was called away upon urgent
business, and Zorilda, having thrown on a cloak,
glided secretly down the back stairs, and passing
up a path lined with cypress, gained the
church-yard, which had long been her favourite
haunt. It was a romantic spot, in which she
loved to listen to the sullen roar of the gathering
storm, or the melancholy sighing of the sea
breezes as they whistled through the long wiry
grass which waved upon the walls of a ruined
abbey overhung with ivy, that still outlived
the wreck of time, and stood a monument of
former days. An ancient yew tree, which tossed
its old fantastic roots high in air, with flattened
crown, over which the northern blast from Kinnaird's
head swept nippingly, overshadowed a
gloomy corner of this wild and desolate cemetery.
Thither Zorilda bent her steps. Pausing as she
approached the spot, the curlieu's plaintive wail
struck upon her ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hah! that is my funeral knell! it is a gracious
and a cheering sound; a requiem of welcome
omen."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<small>I love to linger in the narrow field</small><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<small>Of rest&mdash;to wander round from tomb to tomb</small>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<small>And think of some who silent sleep below</small>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She turned round an angle of the old building,
as she mused, and reaching her accustomed
rocky seat, beneath the yew tree's matted roof,
"This," said she, "shall be my resting place!
Ocean! thou image of eternity! thy breath is
balmy, and wafts freedom to my bosom. Here
will I trace the simple memorial which shall
mark my grave. Ambition! but for thee, how
different had been my fate; but the pilot who
guided my bark, can never err. I have required
long discipline to teach me; but at last
I see the heavenly scheme which comprehends
a wider range than this poor nether sphere can
supply. Why is it so difficult to justify the
ways of God to man, but that we seek results
on faith, which are furnished only in a higher
scene. My father, I acknowledge my stubbornness
and stupidity. Thou hast dealt with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
thus, that we might meet in the mansions of
glory, where all tears shall be wiped away.
What are the brief enjoyments of this fleeting
world, when compared with the celestial communion
of those who are purified in the furnace
of affliction! Yes, we shall meet father, mother,
Algernon! Oh! my burning brow; my beating
heart. How I long for the green pastures
and refreshing waters, which are promised to
the weary pilgrim! Had I been what the world
calls happy, I should have loved it too well, and
built my tabernacle on its unstable sands. My
God resolved to bring me home to more abiding
felicity than I could have known below; there,
I grow faint: this feeble outline is all that I
can sketch, but Lionel shall finish it. That
dear friend shall perform Zorilda's last earthly
purpose, and place this memento where she lies.
Oh that I were already laid beneath the verdant
turf! but my tarrying will not be long&mdash;my
strength is exhausted."</p>

<p>She made an effort to rise, but her bending
limbs refused their office. Her eyes grew dim,
and unable to recover herself, she fell back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the arms of him, whose name she had just pronounced.</p>

<p>"Adored Zorilda! thy Lionel is here, and
Clara is at this moment seeking her best beloved
friend at Drumcairn. Oh speak! Raise those
precious eye-lids, and look on one who is devoted
to thee! Speak, oh say but one word,
and relieve this agony of dread!"</p>

<p>She heard not; saw not; felt not. She had
fallen asleep to wake no more, and at her feet
the pencil lay, with which she had just traced
an urn, veiled in clouds, through which the
name of Zorilda was faintly discernible, and on
its pedestal were engraved the words,</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>On calling lately at the house of a friend who
was indisposed, I found him in his study wrapped
in a dressing gown, and turning over, with pensive
air, the leaves of a dust-brown manuscript,
which lay open before him on the table.</p>

<p>"What have you got here? have you turned
author, or are you revising and correcting for
another?" said I, arresting the arm of my friend,
as he was in the act of removing his papers.</p>

<p>"I have been," he replied, "looking over a
cobwebbed memoir of my own life, which has
been one of no ordinary vicissitude. It is a
melancholy pleasure to retrace the path of existence
through a faithful narrative of its events;
and compare ourselves with ourselves in different
stages of our progress. I have not glanced at
this moth-eaten record for upwards of twenty
years, and feel, after closing it, as if I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
conversing with the dead; but let me place it
on its shelf again, and we will talk on more
agreeable subjects."</p>

<p>"Not till I have possession," said I, darting
forwards and seizing the manuscript. An intimacy
of long standing pleaded excuse for this
abrupt measure. I took home my booty, read
the memoir; and felt so deeply interested in a
story which I knew to be true, that I entreated
permission to give it to my printer. "I thought,
at one time, of publishing it," replied my friend,
"but afterwards relinquished the idea. The experience
of one man never guides another. All
people like to purchase their own; but provided
you change every name of place or person
which might inflict a wound in any breast,
you may do as you please with my tale of other
times."</p>

<p>I promised, and have performed, so let no

genealogy or geography, seek acquaintance with
any character or locality introduced in the following

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>"A bramble at the eye is larger than an oak
at a distance," and thus every man is of importance
in his own view; and imagines that he
could communicate something of profit or pleasure
by recounting the results of his individual
experience. But the most remarkable adventures,
as well as the sagest remarks, are forgotten,
if they are merely the subjects of fire-side
reminiscence; and people are deterred from
making public the events of their own lives
through the terror of imputed egotism, however
well they may feel inclined to impart a
benefit to their species. In this dilemma, between
vanity and forgetfulness, much useful
warning is withheld from the world, since all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
agree that one fact is more valuable than
volumes of theory.</p>

<p>This train of meditation was awakened by
unpacking a case, in which a pile of journals,
which I had kept from early youth, met my
eye. Many a bitter recollection rose upon my
mind, as I arranged them according to order;
but <i>coute qui coute</i>, I resolved that I would collect
my scattered memoranda, and attempt a
sketch of my own history. The retrospect was
painful; but if a single fellow-being might be
instructed by a narrative of my errors, I felt
that I should be rewarded; and even should no
second person peruse these pages, a review of
the past will be good for my own heart.</p>

<p>Inspired by these reflections, I begin by saying,
who I am and whence I came. My name is Albert
Fitzmaurice, and my birth-place the western
extremity of a certain county in Ireland. My
father was a clergyman of the Established
Church, who, though born likewise in Ireland,
was of English parentage, and received an Oxford
education, which was a greater distinction
in his day than it is at present, when the intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
between the Sister Kingdoms has softened
down, or obliterated so many national differences
amongst their inhabitants.</p>

<p>Charles Fitzmaurice, for that was my father's
name, was an accomplished gentleman, according
to that high standard which never varies in
all the changes of time and taste. Amiable,
classical, and refined, he sought a congenial
partner to mitigate the horrors of the banishment
to which he was doomed at eight and
twenty by his ecclesiastical patron; and as the
females of that period were distinguished from
each other by varieties not entirely comprehended
under the endorsement of "black, brown,
and fair;" my father was fortunate enough to
find a companion whose fine understanding and
heavenly sweetness of disposition maintained a
perpetual sunshine of the soul wherever she
moved.</p>

<p>In the present artificial state of society, when
rank and fortune are generally considered necessary
to refinement, I shall encounter the curled lip
and elevated eye-brow of disdain if I venture to
assert that my parents were amongst the happiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
specimens of polished elegance, though they
could neither boast of wealth nor title. There is a
dignity of mind, which, borrowing nothing from
the Proteus fashion of the day, rises gracefully
in its own strength, and is suited to all times,
because, proceeding from solid principles, it is
not indebted to the changeful caprices of the
passing hour. Surely that politeness which has
its foundation in the heart, and which may be
defined good nature sent to school, is the only
genuine sort, permanent in its influence, and of
universal application.</p>

<p>Such was the kind with which I was acquainted
in the home of my early existence.
As the shores appear to glide by the skimming
bark in the sweet calm of a summer sky, while
in reality they are fixed and immoveable, so did
the suavity of parental affection temper discipline
to such a degree, that commands put on
the gentle aspect of request, which none but
demons could have resisted; and retirement,
which precluded any attempt at awkward imitation,
imparted all that ease and self-possession,
which are the essence of good society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Situated in a wild and thinly peopled district,
though in one of the most populous of all
countries, this excellent pair began their wedded
career on the humble pittance of five hundred
<i>per annum</i>, which sum, however, it must be remembered,
embraced a much wider proportion
of comfort than the same income could at present
procure. During many tranquil years my
parents pursued "the noiseless tenor of their
way," rich in each other's love, and happy because
their mutual attachment was built on sympathy
in virtue, which wears brighter instead of
being destroyed by use. They lived, it is true,
in what modern language styles the deepest obscurity;
but <i>really</i> in the meridian light of truth
and contentment. A numerous tribe of olive
branches sprang around their table; and notwithstanding
the straightened finances which
supplied their wants, each addition to the
family group was hailed with affection, which
seemed to increase in fervor with every new
direction of its course.</p>

<p>The chief delight of my father and mother
consisted in bestowing upon their offspring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
every advantage which their own acquirements,
and whatever instruction they could attain
at such a distance from the capital, enabled
them to impart. An excellent library lent its
aid to their efforts, but the quiet routine of a
country life, in which each day certified of
another, however pleasingly diversified for the
actors in a domestic group, is too monotonous to
interest such as may be strangers to those endearing
relations which produce, in breasts that
feel their influence, an unceasing supply of excitement;
and therefore my readers (if readers
I should have) will readily dispense with all the
particulars of my childhood, and thank me for
retarding their introduction to the parsonage
of Glendruid, in the wilds of the west, till about
the year ninety-seven, when I was a full grown
youth of eighteen, tall, active, and manly. Truth
compels me, in thus declaring how many summers
I had numbered at the commencement of
my story, to destroy <i>in limine</i> any romantic visions
with which the fairer part of creation may
be inspired, if any amongst them should deign
to turn my title page in fond belief of meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
with a youthful hero, under the not <i>unnovel</i> like
appellation which I bear. It is true that I <i>have
been</i> young, giddy, and adventurous; and if I
am no longer the Albert of former days, it is
because time will do his silent work without
regard to the prayer of beauty, and hurry his
victim forward unmindful of every entreaty preferred
by either sex, to stay his merciless career.
But to my tale.</p>

<p>All who have lived as long as I have done,
will recollect that the epoch of which I write
was one of violent commotion in the minds of
Irishmen. The revolutionary spirit of France
had crossed the seas, and while actively fermenting
the population of my country, was as rapidly
decomposing the substance of religion and
morals. What was called a thirst of inquiry,
a search after truth, liberality of opinion, unprejudiced
reason, and many such misnomers,
was in fact, a burning desire to demolish the
entire structure of civilized institution, and send
mankind again into the woods as hunters and
shepherds, to emerge anew from the elements
of natural society. Man differs not more from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the very antipodes of his own character in
another person, than he does from himself in
distant periods of his life, and I almost doubt
my identity in retracing the days of my youth,
when I was one of those who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"<small>Bawl for freedom in their senseless mood</small>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>And still revolt when truth would set them free</small>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>License they mean when they cry liberty</small>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Glendruid Glebe was situated in one of the
wildest spots of earth; and the only old wood,
though of dwarfish size, which the whole district
for many miles could boast, embellished the
precipitous sides of a ravine close to my father's
dwelling, into which the Atlantic billows rushed
as impetuously as if they sought asylum in our
sheltered creek from some sea monster. The
rocks which lined this mountain <i>gash</i>, were
chafed into fretwork, resembling honey-comb
by the constant friction of returning tides, and
assumed a thousand fantastic forms along the
shore as far as the eye could reach. Surrounded
by these rugged masses, it was my
delight, in childhood, to watch the seals as they
lay basking in the sunshine upon our rocks, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
listen with charmed attention to the "sob of the
wave," as it struggled through those stony
syphons which had been perforated by the ocean
waters. Seated under the blast-riven trunk of
a stunted oak, I used to weave the web of future
fate while yet a boy, and all my day-dreams
were of happiness and virtue.</p>

<p>In the same nook, at a later period, did I
plan the revolution of the state, and trampling,
by anticipation, all institutions, human and
divine, beneath my feet, revel in the wishes for
success of anarchy and scepticism. Alas! what
a vapour is man throughout his seven ages,
when not governed by the spirit of God within
his breast! How easy is the transition from
good to evil, and how ingenious that sophistry
which blends the most discordant elements into
one favourite system!</p>

<p>Having briefly sketched the character of my
parents, and set them down amid the Irish Alps,
I must proceed to speak of two other families
by whom our western wilderness was peopled,
and who were unhappily the only near neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of Glendruid, except a pair of ecclesiastics,
hereafter to be described.</p>

<p>John Talbot Esq. was a gentleman of fortune,
that is to say, according to an interpretation
which would often be found to explain that title
in Ireland, he possessed a large tract of territory
in fee, and appeared the undisputed Lord of a
widely spread though barren domain, while his
revenues were so circumscribed, that had it not
been for the high-ways and bye-ways of ocean,
and a great subterranean vault in which tobacco,
tea, and brandy, found convenient hiding place,
all but the common necessaries of life would
often have been wanting. He was a man of
education, just enough to be as mischievous as
possible in such a country as Ireland, where
the materials of combustion are always at hand,
and only require a breath to blow them. Mr.
Talbot was not a scholar, and therefore perhaps
it was that he held learning and science in the
profoundest contempt. He read, however, all
the publications of the day, and was well versed
in the French school; while newspapers, pamphlets,
and reviews, light, loose, and in constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
succession, supplied him with stores for the furtherance
of his daily purpose in fanning discontent
amongst the people.</p>

<p>His family had been originally Roman Catholic,
but some intermarriage introduced property
and Protestantism at the same time into
one of its branches, of which he was the principal
descendant, and he had never gone to mass,
though, unfortunately, he was not nearer to
church on that account. He was an infidel,
and the bookcases at Ferney, a name which,
through admiration of Voltaire, Mr. Talbot
had superinduced on the ancient denomination
of Kimahone, were filled with the voluminous
works of this favourite author, to which were
added those of his Gallic brethren, and the
more recent trash of Godwin, Paine, Volney,
Wolstoncroft, and such like, of indigenous
growth. From these sources he drew his heavy
artillery when required, but as I have stated,
the lighter productions of each day's publication
furnished abundant ammunition for a successful
warfare against religion and loyalty in a
weekly meeting at St. Patrick's cross, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
few miserable huts, built on the confluence of
four mountain tracks, were dignified by the
style and title of town, and yclept Ballymaclashen.</p>

<p>One slated roof raised its head in solitary
pre-eminence in the centre of these mud-walled
tenements, and was commonly called from this
distinguishing circumstance, the "<i>slat-house</i>."
In front of this edifice was a pole, the perpendicular
position of which was preserved by an
immense <i>cairn</i> of rude stones piled round its
base, as though it marked the grave of some
renowned Milesian; and from this pole was
suspended by a pair of rusty hooks, a board, on
which was daubed an equestrian figure attired
in patches of red and green, with a full bottomed
wig, and cocked hat. In my childhood
this warrior was said to represent "King
George the Third <i>a hoss back</i>;" but in after
time, though no change of costume had been
carried into effect on the sign post, the same
red man and white horse were ingeniously metamorphosed
by the landlord into Buonaparte
mounted on his charger. Underneath was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
inscribed, "Lisaned to cell Bere, Ail, &amp; Portur,
as likewize pruf sperrets by Tim Carthy," while
"entertenmant for Man and Hoss," flourished
in a scroll at the bottom to allure the wayfarer
who might stand in need of refreshment in
crossing the moor of Ballymaclashen.</p>

<p>Amongst the meaner habitations of this
wretched hamlet, two or three were distinguished
from the rest by a thin lacquering of
whitewash, which mottled the clayey surface of
the walls into a ground which served to render
legible the ill-spelt and apocryphal announcement,
traced with a burnt stick, that "dry
lodgen" might be found within; while a turf
tied in a string, and fastened by a withy to the
potato stalks, which formed the thatch of these
miserable dwellings, informed travellers of humbler
description that all the inspiration of that
witching herb which affords stimulus in such
variety of charm, was not confined to the elegant
accommodations of Tim, but might be enjoyed
with uncostly "means and appliances."
Smile not, ye sleek and pampered sons of commerce,
who gloat upon the wealth of nations, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
I proceed to shew that even the spirit of competition
was not a stranger to the desert scene
which I am describing. On one of these freckled
fronts, was scrawled the following sentence,
which I shall give in its original orthography,
"Lady ha'punce tuck within and no questions
axed."</p>

<p>For the explanation of this singular inscription,
be it known, that a quantity of counterfeit
copper had got into circulation, to the great
alarm of the country dealers, who became so
suspicious of Hibernia's effigy, that, seized with
a panic, they refused for some time any thing
less than a silver tender, and preferred running
on a doubtful score with their customers, to
risking their little property in exchange for a
base coin of more easy attainment; but the
dread of non-payment and avidity of gain, will
submit to sacrifice, and the extraordinary advertisement
to which I have alluded, was the
device hit upon by Larry Connell, more crafty,
and a bolder speculator than his fellows, for the
purpose of inviting, in the true spirit of monopoly,
all the consumers of his neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and securing an exclusive interest which he
hoped might outlive the temporary inconvenience
of this fraudulent medium of exchange.
"Nothing venture, nothing have," was Larry's
motto, and the event proved his sagacity, for all
the "lady ha'punce" came to his cabin to be
bartered for snuff or illicit whiskey, during a
season, to his cost; but in process of time, when
the base metal disappeared, gratitude and habit
confirmed a preference for our liberal trader,
who, like many of his betters, managed by a
little splash and cunning, to acquire a character
for generosity, while thinking of no interest
except his own. Such is the race of man; varying
in modes; in substance ever the same.</p>

<p>Well! Ballymaclashen would seem but an
unprofitable theatre for the exertion of oratory;
but Cæsar thought it better to be first in a village
than second at Rome, and Mr. Talbot, who was
of the same opinion, did not disdain to wear the
bays which were placed on his brow, to crown
him Anacharsis Cloots of the "Slat House."
There he held his political orgies, and there unrivalled,
uttered many a bold harangue to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
admiring multitude of red-haired, raw-boned,
open-mouthed, and bare-legged peasants, who
flocked from all the adjacent districts to hear
arguments which there was no adversary to oppose;
swallow statements which no one started
up to contradict; and applaud declamations,
one half at least of which they did not understand.</p>

<p>Paddy, however, is a quick intelligent animal,
and as Mr. Talbot was largely gifted with natural
eloquence, and studied to use language of a
popular <i>savour</i>, seasoning the graver topics in
his speeches with that dry humour which to Irish
minds is an irresistible <i>sauce piquante</i>, his auditors
were enabled to catch, and carry away, a
good deal of the matter which he propounded,
and returned to their homes discoursing all the
way, with inflated spirits, of liberty and equality;
the downfall of tithes; the destruction of
kingly government; the partition and recovery
of forfeited estates, with all the other themes of
disaffection then afloat, in their own phraseology,
and with much zeal in these subjects of
discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Talbot had a wife and family, who were
all bitten by the mania of the day, and all practised
according to sex and age, the doctrines
which they had imbibed. The children were
taught from their cradle to abhor an orange dye,
as the livery of Satan, and I well remember
that the first exhibition of prowess manifested
by these youngsters, consisted in an attack with
broad swords made of wood, on all the lilies of
that hue, which could be found in the neighbouring
gardens. A horse-leech which had been
caught in a pool by a plough-boy, and brought
as a curiosity to the young gentlemen, underwent
a merciless <i>auto da fe</i> for the crime of
being spotted with a proscribed colour; and an
old woman narrowly escaped being ducked in
an adjacent pond, for the offence of bringing a
basket of fish to the door, in which the plaice
appeared with forbidden tints. All this, and
much more, was encouraged as wit, and while
the children were in their infancy, the unfortunate
servants, who were condemned to endure
the effects of their undisciplined self-will and
lawless fancies, were the only victims of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
misrule in which they were brought up; but as
time advanced, and energies expanded, the nursery
became an arena too confined for the exercise
of <i>freemen</i>, and a mob of untutored democrats
were now let loose upon the common,
to talk of equal rights, and wield unequal power,
and, like a second deluge of Goths and Vandals,
issue forth the terror and the curse of all around,
to barbarise the human race anew.</p>

<p>As the young Talbots grew to man's estate,
the only practical evidence which they gave of
sincerity in their professions, was discoverable
in their love of low company, not preferred with
the view, it must be added, of exerting any benevolence
towards their inferiors, but for the
pleasure of drilling, dictating to, and domineering
over, all the slavish crew whom poverty and
ignorance, hope or fear, induced to submit to
the tyranny of their control.</p>

<p>Dogs, horses, fishing-rods, were soon disregarded
for the more animating amusement of
training soldiers for the field. At first a harmless
host, armed with bulrushes, assembled on
the green; but these innoxious weapons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
ere long exchanged for more destructive instruments,
and the day-light parade gave place in
time, to nocturnal meetings, to which the mystery
of darkness and silence lent an irresistible
attraction. Albinia Talbot, an Amazonian girl
of sixteen, tall, masculine, and uncommonly
handsome, furnished all her aid to these martial
exercises, and attended her brothers in all their
nightly excursions. Dressed in a green habit,
and mounted on her pony, she would appear at
the rendezvous, and by her presence add the
charm of gallantry to that of prowess.</p>

<p>Albinia's adoption of the rebel politics and
uniform, was the hinge upon which my obedience
turned, and I resolved to be deterred no
longer by any authority from following the bent
of inclination. I had been strictly prohibited
by my father from joining in any of the exploits
of our young neighbours, of which he received
information through some secret channel;
and though strongly tempted by the love
of adventure to transgress the order, I did not
yield till my imagination was fired by the example
of a beautiful female, who, imitating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Semiramises and Hersilias of antiquity, laid aside
the timidity of her sex, and spurning the distaff,
rushed forth, inspired by patriotic ardour in her
country's cause.</p>

<p>"What!" said I, "shall it be said that the
young and lovely Albinia disdains inglorious
ease, and braves the midnight blast, the fatigues
of the field, and the risk of detection, while I
am lying supinely taking my repose? Shall I
be indifferent to the wrongs of that island which
gave me birth, while this noble minded girl, regardless
of self, devotes every energy to the freedom
and happiness of a suffering people?"</p>

<p>The bonds of filial submission had long been
gradually relaxing. I now determined on slipping
the noose, and delivering myself at once
from the restraint by which I had hitherto been
withheld. I had been often solicited to accept
a commission in "<i>the regiment</i>," which name
the young Talbots gave to the rabble rout which
they were dragooning into military array; but
I had refused, much as I envied them, and
wished to join in the enterprize. Albinia however,
as I have said, turned the balance, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the next mountain muster I promised to go.
While I live I shall never forget the rapture
which, notwithstanding all the anxiety incident
to concealment, and the dread of discovery, I
felt at finding myself not only a spectator, but
an actor in a scene so novel and inspiring, as
broke upon my sight, on the first time of keeping
my appointment.</p>

<p>I had several miles to ride to the place of
meeting, at which, when arrived, I found some
hundreds of fine young fellows assembled, who
were regularly marshalled, and put through several
evolutions (which they executed with astonishing
precision) by a man who the Talbots
informed me was a deserter, and in their service.
The place selected for these clandestine
meetings, was admirably calculated for the purpose,
and presented a <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> singularly picturesque
as well as imposing. A mixed and
confused remembrance of every thing romantic
which I had ever read, occurred to my imagination
as I approached the scene. Gil Blas, the
Pretender, and a thousand other recollections
rushed upon my memory, and poured such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
tide of the most delightful visions on my mind,
that when united to a dream of Brutus, and the
Scipios, with the more recent names of those
who were now endangering life and property
for their country's good, nothing was wanting
to complete the enthusiasm with which I made
a vow on the altar of liberty, that night, to devote
my services to the goddess of popular adoration.</p>

<p>The spot on which I met my friends was
deeply embosomed within a circular barrier of
mountains, the outlines of which gracefully intersected
each other, and seemed to close entirely
round a small lake of water, pure and
clear, but dark as Erebus. In the middle of
this lake rose a little green island, beautifully
tufted with elder, yew, and a few withered
stumps of oak, which seemed to tell of better
days.</p>

<p>This sequestered patch of earth appeared to
have been a favourite haunt of various orders
of worshippers, for a gigantic Cromlech reared
its Druid head at no great distance from the remains
of a ruined abbey, furnishing a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
contrast between the durability of its form and
materials, unaltered in the lapse of ages, and
the mouldering fragments which spoke the
vanity of man's best efforts to perpetuate his
fleeting fame.</p>

<p>From the main land to the island, a rude
causeway of enormous stones, narrow, but of
massy structure, was the <i>via sacra</i> by which
thousands of poor pilgrims, led by the most benighted
superstition, annually visited this vestige
of monastic times. I had often heard of
the striking effect produced by the reflection of
St. John's fires from the lake, on the eve of
that saintly vigil when the votaries of papal
dominion used to assemble here and perform
their religious rites; but what is always within
our reach we generally neglect to seek, and so
it was in the present instance.</p>

<p>As I drew near, the pale and tranquil moonbeams
fell upon the commanding form of Albinia,
who, standing on the Cromlech's height,
and arrayed in her vestment of green, addressed
the troop who were listening with devoted zeal,
as though she had been another Joan of Arc, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
every word uttered by her lips. She had
adorned her hat with a branch of the mountain
ash, to the beautiful scarlet fruit of which
Scotland has given the name of rowan berries;
and such was the romance with which I gazed
on her figure, that she seemed no other in that
moment to my eyes, than the genius of Erin
awakening from a tedious slumber to invoke the
justice of Heaven on her beloved country. I
wept as I mused on the scene of enchantment
before me, while a projecting crag still kept me
out of view, but the tears which I then shed,
were the last that bedewed my cheeks for many
a day. I was about to enter the labyrinth of
that false philosophy which hardens the heart,
and every remnant of tender feeling was attacked
with such ridicule by my new advisers,
who set their faces against <i>sentiment</i> of whatever
kind, that, under their tuition, I quickly learned
to despise all natural impulses of the human
breast.</p>

<p>After pausing for a few minutes to contemplate
the assembly, I left my screen, and
appeared in full front of the band. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
received with such welcome and applause as
flattered my vanity to intoxication. No hero,
ancient or modern, could have felt himself
more elevated by the well-earned clang of triumph
than I did at hearing my praises sounded
by a mob of deluded peasants. Albinia appointed
me immediately to a company in the
corps; she seemed to act as <i>generalissima</i> on
the occasion, and to exercise unlimited control
over this rebel multitude, who looked upon her
as inspired.</p>

<p>I was informed by my fair commandant, that
she expected much from my skill, bravery, and
judgment; and I resolved to repay the confidence
thus reposed, by the most entire submission
to my lovely chief, and the most perfect
devotion to the cause which she supported. I
longed for some distinguishing badge of favour,
and would gladly have received a scarf, or glove,
or even the rowan wreath, which would have
turned to amaranth in my keeping, but I am
obliged to confess that Albinia was not a gentle
Dulcinea; abrupt almost to coarseness, she
shook me rather roughly by the hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
presenting me a pistol and powder-horn, said,
"There! I commit these to you, and as you see
that as yet we are but slenderly provided with
either arms or ammunition, I request you to
make good use of what is now entrusted to your
care."</p>

<p>Our <i>regiment</i> was composed, as I have mentioned,
of some hundred fine brawny youths.
They were all dressed in linen shirts which they
wore over their ragged clothes. This garb had
the double advantage of giving an air of uniformity,
and also of being easily slipped off in
case of a surprise, against the occurrence of
which we endeavoured to guard, by always keeping
a watch in the passes which led to our rendezvous.
Our band were armed with clubs of
white-thorn, elder, or whatever else they could
procure. A few of them had old military belts
and feathers, which served to mark the corporals
and sergeants; the officers being supplied
from the houses of Ferney and Painesville.</p>

<p>So infatuated was I by these martial exercises,
that in spite of the repugnance which I knew
my parents felt to an intimacy on my part with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the Lovetts and Talbots, I gave myself up to
them; and, though by stealth, contrived to be a
punctual attendant on the musters. A brisk
correspondence, in which my brothers had been,
as I discovered, employed long before I was
called upon to join, existed between us and all
the <i>mauvais sujets</i> in the country. Military
tactics formed but a part of the schemes on
foot. As an auxiliary branch of united Irishmen,
we had our committees, secretaries, treasurers,
and central offices, to which we communicated
whatever information we had been enabled
to collect, and which we considered likely
to advance our schemes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Such was the state of affairs at the period of
which I write, as touching our <i>public</i> functions;
but the condition of private life remains to be
unfolded; and as the inhabitants of Glendruid
were not the leaders, but the led, I will begin
with causes before I proceed to effects, and describe
the situation of affairs at <i>Painesville</i>, formerly
known by the appellation of Lovett-lodge,
and exhibiting a complete pandemonium at the
time in which my tale may be said to commence.
Looking back on Mr. Lovett's family with the
sobered views of forty-five, I must own that
nothing could be more preposterously absurd
than the inversion of all natural order in his
house.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lovett were pupils of that
school which directly sprang from the French
revolution, though they had not drank so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of the poisoned chalice as to be openly professed
advocates of irreligion or immorality. They
were republicans; and held all the incompatible
doctrines which contradict each other, and the
unfortunate consequences of which are precisely
as apparent under a single roof as in a nation.
Of such nature were the dogmas of liberty and
equality, so utterly at variance with the constitution
of created things, that were they introduced
by the divine fiat over the face of the
whole globe in perfect balance at the moment of
its formation, one generation could not pass
away without witnessing the destruction of a
state inconsistent with the unequal proportions
of strength and intellect awarded by our Maker
to his creatures, and therefore never designed to
be continued amongst them.</p>

<p>The uproar of a democracy met the eye and
ear on crossing the threshold of the door at
Painesville, where eight children were permitted,
from the earliest age, to exercise their several
talents for disputation without the slightest restraint.
Assertion passed for argument, roughness
was styled sincerity, and contempt of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
authority was called the light of reason. When
first I became acquainted with manners so dissimilar
from those to which I had been used at
Glendruid, I was struck with an unfavourable
impression, and felt like one who is suddenly
introduced from a purer atmosphere into one
that is contaminated; but the moral and physical
senses become alike accustomed to vitiated
air, and we learn to breathe freely where suffocation
seemed to threaten. I soon imbibed
enough of the popular <i>Malaria</i> to be quite at
home; and though conscious that paradoxes
were imposed upon my understanding, against
which the unbiassed mind revolted, I speedily
adopted the nomenclature, and learned to call
things by names which were foreign to their
nature; right and wrong often changed places,
and I became an adept in the language of "natural
justice&mdash;tyranny of the laws&mdash;folly of legislation&mdash;wickedness
of power&mdash;sovereignty of
reason," and the disgusting farrago of a period
now gone by, but which, though its grosser
errors are disclaimed by the more judicious, has
left much of its leaven behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>At Painesville there was nothing but incessant
discussion, replication, rejoinder, mooting
of futile questions, and disrespectful contradiction.
Talents were held to be the one thing
needful; and though the heads of the family
did not carry matters to such lengths as to pronounce
that religion and morals were of no
value, yet the whole bearing of conversation
tended to loosen all existing ties with either the
one or the other. Every subject was tried by
the test of reason; not meaning the reason of
the wise, the informed, the experienced&mdash;but of
the young, the pert, and superficial. The rapid
conclusions of ingenuity put to flight the sober
maxims of truth and knowledge. Whatever
was rendered venerable by the sanction of time
was <i>litigated</i>, and brought to the bar anew, to be
tried by a self impanelled jury. At Painesville
it was decreed that, "relationship was a mere
accident, which ought not to infringe on the
liberty of the subject, by conveying any right.
Children, it was argued, were not consulted as
to their choice&mdash;they did not give consent to be
brought into the world; consequently there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
was no covenant. Nature declared for equality,
in the inferior creation, as soon as animals acquired
physical power to take care of themselves.
Why should man be the only exception to a law
thus general, and with superior endowments be
excluded from the charter enjoyed by every
other living creature?"</p>

<p>It is painful, even now, to retrace, at this distance
of time, the dicta of a philosophy which
has become nearly obsolete, and the very remembrance
of which ought to be expunged;
but I am giving the history of my own times;
and facts which I must narrate require a retrospect
of those modes of thinking which gave
them birth. The intelligent reader, who is
aware of the moral confusion which followed,
upon the adoption of those principles introduced
by the French revolution, will easily fill up the
rough sketch which I have attempted of the
Lovett family, and be enabled to anticipate, in
idea, all the consequences exhibited in the minuter
detail of their lives. Such a reader will
easily guess, that on the part of the parents
was presented a wild assumption of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
destructive principles which led to the dismemberment
of that country from which they were
unhappily imported; while the offspring, as
might naturally be expected, found too much
that was gratifying both to pride and vanity, in
the lessons which they were taught, not to seize
them with avidity; and Painesville accordingly
exhibited a saturnalia where the rulers and the
ruled exchanged places.</p>

<p>All was chaos and usurpation; Mr. and Mrs.
Lovett boasted of the equality which reigned in
their family, and rejected every idea of governing
their children by means of parental discipline.
Fear was decided to be a slavish sentiment,
which was not allowed place amongst the
motives which ought to actuate rational beings.
"Man was born free, and judgment was given
as the only guide of action. Affections were
mere instincts unworthy of swaying the conduct;
and duty was an imposition on the privileges of
the human race."</p>

<p>The young people were not long in convincing
their father and mother that the relation of
equal fraternity, once substituted for that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
parent and child, it is no easy matter to retrace
the path, and when the evils of misrule become
intolerable from the numbers and the strength
of those whom it influences, to exchange them
for the blessings of legitimate control. The colt
too long at large will not readily submit to bit
and bridle; and that rider who would attempt
to enforce the unwonted restraint, will soon be
rendered practically sensible of his mistake.</p>

<p>At Painesville all the members of the family
talked together, which seemed the only symptom
of concert amongst them. They quoted
Rousseau, D'Alembert, Gibbon, Hume, Volney,
at every sentence. With these authors I was
not acquainted, as they made no part of the
study furniture at Glendruid; but, as I have
said already, though conscience winced in the
outset from doctrines so little in unison with
those of home, I was an apt pupil, and speedily
adopted a new system of thinking.</p>

<p>My two brothers, who were senior to me,
had entered the University in the year that
preceded that of the Irish rebellion; and though
they never remained more than a few days at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
each examination in the metropolis, yet my
father's parochial duties frequently interfering
with his power of accompanying them, these
short visits in Dublin were sufficient to bring
them acquainted with all that was in progress,
such was the activity that characterized at that
juncture the republican energies in Ireland.</p>

<p>The elder of these youths, whose name was
Harold, was particularly amiable, and became
the victim of designing men, who worked successfully
on his generosity to draw him into their
snares. He took up the theory of Godwin, and
believed, with more sincerity than his master, in
the infinite perfectibility of the human race.
Ascribing all the evil which he beheld under
the sun to the various corruptions of administration,
and the venality of governors, benevolence
was in fact the destroying angel of <i>his</i>
mind; and he would gladly have prostrated
princes in the dust, and overthrown their seats
of empire, in order to secure "<i>the people</i>" in
the enjoyment of every good.</p>

<p>Short-sighted politicians, who, rejecting the
light of experience, fell into the error of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
expecting universal order, out of particular derangement,
and general virtue, as the result of
individual crime! Harold's was a benign spirit,
which wished well to every thing that breathed;
but he was not proof against the seductions of
the popular creed, and became completely entangled
in speculations worthy of the source
from which they emanated. His temper, which
had been naturally sweet, and open as the
morning breeze, changed to dark, sullen, and
secretive. He had been, deservedly, a darling
with the best of mothers, and her grief at his
altered deportment may be more easily conceived
than described. It was not that he designed,
"as of malice prepense," to behave uncourteously,
but his mind was absolutely absorbed.
The amusements which had hitherto
delighted, no longer afforded interest. His favourite
dog&mdash;his garden&mdash;his collection of shells
and minerals, were all neglected. Harold, who
used to wander for miles along the sea-shore in
quest of specimens with which to enrich his
store, and who hastened to bring the fruits of
his labour to that gentle being, the kindness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
whose smile might have warmed the breast of
an anchorite, and whose ready participation in
whatever gave pleasure to others rendered her in
better times the beloved friend as well as mother
of her children&mdash;lived now immured in his bed-chamber,
the door of which he kept locked
while he was within it, and the key was always
put into his pocket when he left the house.</p>

<p>How he was employed no one could tell, as
no trace of book, pen, ink, or writing was discoverable
at those times when old Margaret, a
faithful domestic who lived in my family during
several years, had access to his apartment. One
day, however, in sweeping the room, she discovered
a small bit of paper which had been torn
from a larger piece, and escaped the flames to
which it had been probably destined. "Central
Committee," "Western District," "French
Forces," were the only words from which any
surmise could be collected; and these were
enough to alarm her, to whom they bore evident
testimony of league in those treasonable plots
which were threatening to involve the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
in civil discord, and endanger the lives and property
of thousands.</p>

<p>Margaret, who was well acquainted with the
anxious state of my mother's mind, took the fragment
to her, and the latter, watching an opportunity
to remark the effect which it might produce
upon her son, fixed her eyes steadily upon
him as he entered the room where she sat, saying,
"Harold, is not this your hand-writing?"</p>

<p>"I am sure it is hard to tell; perhaps it may
be," was my brother's reply; uttered so coldly,
so carefully, as to baffle inquiry, and convince
my mother that any further scrutiny would lead
but to a more artful avoidance of the truth, as
well as more cunning contrivance for future concealment.
She therefore refrained from asking
another question, but heaved a sigh as she
quitted her seat to gain the sanctuary of her
closet.</p>

<p>There <i>had</i> been a time when that sigh would
have agonized the soul of Harold, could he have
believed himself to be the cause of drawing it
forth; but his affections were seared, and he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
his mother turn from him with a breaking heart,
undisturbed by the slightest emotion. My second
brother possessed neither Harold's talents,
nor my romance. He was more phlegmatic
and common-place than any of the family. Yet
he, too, was infected by the distemper of the times,
and had his part assigned him, in which he was
more useful than if he had been considered
equal to higher purposes. He had ever been
fond of shooting and fishing, and as these sports
were continued as usual, he was not suspected of
taking much concern in political matters, and
was therefore employed as a safe ambassador,
frequently leaving our once peaceful abode,
loaded with despatches which were to be deposited
in the ivied wall of a ruined castle, at
some distance from Glendruid. All who met
him supposed that lines, flies, and sandwiches,
constituted the entire freight of a wicker basket
which, strapped upon his back, was in reality the
vehicle of a correspondence, the discovery of
which would have doomed its authors to inevitable
destruction. The plans thus carried on
were, it is true, carefully wrapped in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
concealment of cypher, but a key is easily found to
the most cunning contrivance of this kind; and
in fact at a later period, our devices were all
brought to light.</p>

<p>I have said that my father's circumstances
were very limited, and I should not revert to
a subject which involves the remembrance of
privations as humiliating to pride as distasteful
to sense, were it not to preserve a recollection of
our real situation in the minds of such as may
read my story, and furnish some excuse for the
wanderings of youth, debarred as we were from
the enjoyment of those advantages which depend
upon wealth. Books we had, and a great
many of them, but they had ceased to charm.
The standard works of a former day were not
in vogue; the new philosophy had extinguished
the wisdom of antiquity, and reduced it to a
dead letter, and the flippant apothegms of the
day, whether applied to religion, morals, or
politics, were accounted the only knowledge
worth possessing.</p>

<p>I had no money to procure the modern publications,
but the Talbots and Lovetts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
bountifully supplied, and always ready to lend. I
devoured, therefore, with famished appetite, all
that I could beg or borrow, and conveyed my
treasure to that rocky recess which I have described,
where, with industry worthy of a better
object, I used to read whatever was recommended
by my evil instructors. My poor father,
who was an excellent scholar, found himself at
length deserted in his study, from which his
sons retired one by one, leaving this affectionate
parent to mourn over the shipwreck of a sanguine
spirit, which had delighted to anticipate
with prophetic zeal the honours of his children,
and wreathe their brows with academic glory;
but a "killing frost" was preparing to nip the
tender germ of hope, and destroy every shoot
from which the chaplet of future fame might be
derived.</p>

<p>Those who have never been parents cannot,
I believe, form an adequate conception of the
sorrow reserved for those who, after having
passed one half of life in expectation, are doomed
to spend the other in disappointment, and reap
a blighted crop in return for devoted love and
unslumbering solicitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>We were no doubt unlucky in the society
which chequered the domestic sameness of our
home; not that intercourse with archangels
would have deterred us in all probability from
joining in the general frenzy, but our course
was perhaps accelerated by the want of a
stronger counteracting influence than any which
opposed our progress. The adjoining parishes
were under the superintendence of two clergymen,
both intimates at Glendruid. They frequently
visited at our house, and were good
men, but in no way calculated to control the
spirit of insubordination which was in movement,
nor stem the torrent of that voluble disaffection
which was always ready to pour forth
abuse upon every thing really valuable and of
sound repute.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill, who lived within a mile of Glendruid,
and had the parish adjoining ours, was
a gentleman in education, descent, and manners.
He was at once genteel, moral, and zealous in
the performance of what he believed to be his
duty; but he was a weak man, a <i>tête bornée</i>, a
formalist. Though his age did not exceed forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
years when I left home, he had a face so long-drawn
that it looked as if the grand inquisitors
had got hold of it, and put his features <i>to the
question</i>. His countenance was solemn, but
not from power or depth of mind, and presented
the oddest mixture imaginable of gravity and
imbecility. The physiognomy tallied exactly
with the structure of his mind, which was a
union of <i>sounding</i> sense, with the veriest impotence
of reason which I have ever happened to
witness.</p>

<p>Even at this distance of time, I can still
fancy that I hear his long-winded harangues,
and listen to his well-turned periods, unenlivened
by a single ray of mental illumination,
though uttered with grammatical accuracy, and
the truest attention to accent and emphasis.
Whether the conversation related to a mouse
or a mammoth, the same laborious correctness
of diction, the same flaccid sternness of expression,
marked his dull observations on either the
one or the other. If church matters were the
subject of discussion, he would treat with equal
gravity the divine right of tithes or the bleaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of a surplice; and seemed quite incapable
of seeing any gradation of sin between an atheist
and a dissenter from the rubric of our English
Prayer-book. He would no more have altered
the shape of his band, than he would have
changed his creed, and would have been nearly
as much shocked by seeing the pulpit of his
church transplanted to the opposite side of the
building, as to have encountered a denial of the
thirty-nine articles.</p>

<p>From such a man little aid to a sinking
cause was to be expected, and I well remember
the uneasiness of my father whenever Mr. Hill
entered the lists of theological controversy, from
the unfortunate hand which he made of an argument.
There was enough of importance,
however, in the bearing of the man, to prevent
his being summarily put down, though every
topic of human inquiry withered into nothing
in his nerveless grasp. In short, he was a pompous
nonentity, who, like an empty cart, made
more noise than a full one; and a rumbling
succession of sounds supplied the place of sense,
covering the deficiency of his faculties from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
view of stupid people with whom he passed for
an oracle. We of the new school resolved all
the inflated emptiness of this good man into
the absurdity of his profession, and, as is usual
with the scoffing fraternity, visited on religion
whatever lack of skill we discovered in her advocates.</p>

<p>Such was our clerical neighbour on one side,
while on the other resided the Reverend Mr.
Stockdale, a man in every way different from
him already pourtrayed. Tall and muscular of
frame, commanding in aspect, and powerful in
understanding, but irritable of temper, Mr.
Stockdale resented with vivacity the rapid inroads
which a shallow but impetuous torrent of
new fangled doctrines was daily making upon
all the solid bulwarks of ancient authority. He
was a person of strong intellect and great erudition;
but the powers of his mind were precluded
from assisting him in debate, through the impatience
of his honest indignation; galled and
provoked at the changes which he beheld working
destruction all around, he was not calm
enough to contend with a callow brood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
upstarts, who offered perpetual resistance, in every
word which they uttered, to that creed established
in unmolested sway within his breast,
during a ministry of thirty years. During this
long lapse of time not a doubt had troubled his
repose, not a single adversary till now, had ever
disputed the grounds of his faith.</p>

<p>When this excellent man made his appearance
occasionally at Painesville or Ferney, he
was attacked on all sides with rude disregard of
his sacred calling, and though primed and
loaded with ammunition, a moderate dose of
which would have frittered the puny opponents
arrayed against him to atoms, yet unluckily it
was not <i>ready</i> for the conflict. Long disuse
had rusted over a fine piece of ordnance; the
<i>cannon</i> missed fire, and not only required to be
rubbed up, but to be set to a lower level, to
make it available. Thus it unfortunately happened
that a set of reasoning coxcombs, who
owed their apparent triumph to pertness and
audacity, often seemed for a time masters of
the field; and, silenced by the presumption of
these tyro combatants, the worthy pastor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
frequently surprised into excitement of temper,
and returned discomfited to his rectory-house,
bewailing, as he regained the mountain fastness,
the flood of infidelity which had burst upon the
land, and his own incapacity to arrest its desolating
progress.</p>

<p>The rebel crew were not slow to find out here
again, that religion could not be of celestial
origin, because Mr. Stockdale, pushed to extremity
by the taunts of arrogance, was not endued
with that unalterable coolness which the indifference
of scepticism can assume at will. He
could not always curb, as prudence dictated, the
ebullitions of a holy zeal which lighted spontaneously
into flame, when all that he possessed
on earth, or desired in heaven, was assailed with
wanton disrespect and indecency. He wore also
a large cauliflower wig, a deep shovel hat, long
waistcoat pockets descending to his knees, and
leaned on a cane, with a head of battered gold.
This costume served to sharpen our ridicule,
and increase the vexation which awaited our
friendly neighbour, whenever he quitted the
protection of his upland dwelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>At Glendruid I might ever behold the influence
of piety in preserving the most beautiful
equanimity of temper under the provocations
which every hour produced; but I had been
too well taught to give credit to any thing under
the paternal roof. Parents in <i>my</i> day were
held in contempt, as mere instruments by which
being was conferred on another generation, and
the opinion of a father or mother was so far from
giving a bias to the conduct of their offspring,
that their approval of any person, book, or sentiment,
principle, or mode of action, was considered
by us of the philosophic school as <i>primâ
facie</i> evidence against whatever was so applauded.</p>

<p>The restricted society of our house received
occasional addition likewise from the visits of
two elderly ladies, who were first cousins of my
father. The Misses Cresswell were frequent
members of our family circle, and served to
whet my genius as well as excite my spleen.
They were women of real virtue and high principle,
but doggedly tenacious. They thought
together upon every matter of judgment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
would not give up an iota upon any one subject
of debate. I hated, and used to take delight in
stirring them to opposition, by an assault on
some of their favourite tenets. They piqued
themselves on their orthodoxy, and were what is
called high church; <i>so</i> high, that I detested
steeples for their sakes. They lived in the
"Black North," and were but slenderly provided
for, yet ever employed in doing good; and
nothing distressed my parents so much as to see
them ill-treated.</p>

<p>The quaint wardrobe of these two old women,
was another source of merriment. They seemed
as if newly shaken out of lavender whenever
they came to Glendruid, and I preferred the
savour of garlick to the perfume of that fragrant
herb, which was associated with the idea of my
cousins Cresswell. I have been since reminded
of my own unwarrantable prejudice, by hearing
a friend of mine declare, that he could not endure
the works of a celebrated author, because
he always found a volume of them open on the
table of his dentist, and the finest passages were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
combined in his memory with some piercing
pang or awkward chasm in his jaws.</p>

<p><i>My</i> imagination had no such train of cause
and effect to urge in defence of my rude conduct
towards these my harmless relations, and as they
are dead and gone they will know nothing of
my repentance; but their blind deference to
names and forms was to be lamented. Provided
that a man wore lawn sleeves, it little mattered
whether he was wise or foolish, learned or unlearned:
he was a <i>Bishop</i>, and, according to
their creed, whatever he uttered must necessarily
be law and gospel. "My dear, the Reverend
Mr. Smiler had it from his Lordship's own
mouth," was an unanswerable reply to an objector
against any fact related in the presence of
these good souls.</p>

<p>One day I ventured to retort to this invincible
argument, "And what care I for the bench
of Bishops, if they talk nonsense? Many of them
hide asses ears under their great wigs."</p>

<p>Such a speech was the acme of impropriety,
and was repeated with uplifted hands and eyes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
my iniquity was then considered at its height,
and every day furnishing new cause for animadversion,
the visits of our cousins became at first
less frequent, and were then discontinued.</p>

<p>My brother Charles and I rejoiced that we
had frightened away the musty lavender bags,
and should hear no more quotations from Saint
Chrysostom. I have not yet mentioned my sisters,
the number of whom was reduced by death
from five to two. I had been deeply attached
to Maria, the younger of those who remained;
and till the demon of democracy chased every
amiable feeling from my heart, we had lived in
the most entire harmony and confidence. Notwithstanding
the unceasing efforts of my brothers
and me, to warp the minds of these dear girls,
they resisted every evil impression. It was sufficient
for them to know that their parents disapproved,
to turn them from any temptation,
however alluring; but their virtuous resolution
obtained the character of "inflexible obstinacy,
narrow bigotry," or some such equally unkind
and inappropriate appellation.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the soothing tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of their daughters, I know not how my unhappy
father and mother could have sustained their
accumulated afflictions. The loss of their children
had weighed heavily on their spirits, but
these trials, distressing as they were felt to be,
were sent from Heaven, and did not agonize
their disconsolate hearts like the disunion of
those who were spared. They bowed with resignation
to the will of Him who gives and takes
away, and believed that every sorrow from the
Almighty came on an errand of love, to warn or
wean the souls of His creatures. It was the machinations
of the foolish and the bad, that subdued
their minds, and bent them down to the
earth. The events which they saw occurring
daily, confounded their penetration, but with
patient, though broken spirits, they strove to
await the end, baffled as they were in every attempt
to avert or restrain the tide of opinion,
which had become too strong for control.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Such was the gloomy state of affairs at home;
while abroad all was wrapped in a cloud of
mysterious uncertainty. Day after day we met
each other in melancholy estrangement. No
joyous open countenance smiled upon the social
board. No cheerful conversation seasoned the
frugal repast. A deadly silence knew no interruption
except from some endeavour at dry uninteresting
common place, which, like a doubtful
light that serves but to "render darkness visible,"
had the effect of saddening, rather than
enlivening our domestic group. My father was
afraid to trust himself with uttering a syllable
which might lead to discourse upon exasperating
topics, while grief appeared to choke my mother's
voice. Her changing form proclaimed the
undermining work which was going on within,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and sapping the vital holds of her constitution.
Oh! and her unnatural sons were so insensible
to her decline, that though witnessing its progress,
we neither tried to mitigate the symptoms,
nor to console, though it might not be
permitted us to remedy. No length of life can
abate the pain with which I cast my eyes back
upon that angelic being; nor can the penance
of self-reproach extract the sting which is fixed
in my breast by the memory of ingratitude towards
a matchless parent, now no more.</p>

<p>It was our custom to separate directly after
dinner, each desirous to shorten a period of
restraint, and pursue individual occupation
or device. When the weather was fine, we
were generally out of doors, and contrived to
avoid the tea-table, family prayers, and "good
night;" a parting wish now reduced to lifeless
form by the absence of that affection which,
where it grows, imparts and receives a new
spring at each recurring assurance of its existence.
Our evenings were sometimes employed
in secretly furthering the United Irish Correspondence;
at others in galloping over moorland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and mountain, according to appointment with
our fellow conspirators, with whom we had
clandestine meetings almost every day.</p>

<p>Every hour was big with rumour; and suspicion
of treasonable designs began to fall on
many of the higher classes. Informations
poured continually into the castle of Dublin.
The lower ranks were universally disaffected,
while numbers of the gentry were paralyzed by
vague and painful terrors of the coming explosion.
The co-operation of the French was
hoped for by one party, as it was dreaded by
the other; and all believed that the first successful
landing which was effected on our
coasts, would prove the signal for a simultaneous
rising of the people. Many were secretly departing
from their homes to wait the issue in a
place of safety. Others, unable to quit their
local property, or desert their duty, were employed
in using precautionary means to meet
the threatened danger. Revolt and massacre
were talked of. Servants were unfaithful to
their masters. Tenants conspired against their
landlords. The kind "good morrow" of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
passing rustic was converted into a sullen scowl;
and all the friendly courtesy of intercourse between
high and low was exchanged, at this awful
juncture, for distrust on one side, and hatred
on the other. Our moral condition resembled
that in the physical world which precedes the
horrible visitation of an earthquake&mdash;darkness
and the silence of death pervaded the scene of
former life and occupation; and imagination
fabricated a thousand spectres still more terrific
than those perils by which the loyal part of the
community were really surrounded.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the 10th of February,
1798, when the weather, which had been unusually
mild for the time of year, became suddenly
tremendous. The sky lowered; and torrents
of rain broke loose from the clouds, as if
a water-spout had that moment burst over
Glendruid. Such was the unremitting violence
of this deluge that no one could quit the shelter
of a roof, and the whole family found themselves
in the unusual situation of being imprisoned for
several hours together beneath its protection.</p>

<p>The consciousness of having done wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
is as powerful a separatist in morals, as the
principle of caloric in physics; and though confined
within a space of not very wide dimensions,
we contrived to keep aloof from each other.
Sensible of the deep wounds which we had
inflicted, my brothers and I had no inclination
to encounter the reproach which we justly deserved,
and therefore avoided giving an opportunity
for accusation. Not as yet visited by remorse,
we had no desire to make reparation,
and therefore sought to escape the scrutiny
which we resolved should not be satisfied.</p>

<p>The unceasing drench, however, which I
have mentioned, prevented us from leaving the
house, and we were at last obliged to assemble,
not having any excuse to allege for resisting a
summons to that effect. Tea being finished,
and night closing fast upon the dejected circle,
they drew their chairs involuntarily round a
sullen fire, which none of the party appeared
inclined to stir, lest a cheerful blaze might seem
too strongly contrasted with the gloomy features
on which it played. The wind began to rise,
howling at first a piteous wail and moaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
through every crevice which gave it vent. After
a solemn pause, it would then burst at intervals
into gusts which threatened to sweep the earth
and its inhabitants away.</p>

<p>What a being is man! This tempest, heightened
at length to fury, was the first occurrence
which roused within my breast the long unawakened
sense of our deplorable state. There
is something in a violent strife of elements
which forces itself upon the most obdurate spirit,
and strikes conviction of human weakness on
the mind. As I glanced from time to time on
the pale and agitated countenances around me,
I felt oppressed by a sensation which was not
easy to define. It was neither fear nor affection,
but it was a mixture of repentance, with that
desire of communion natural to most mortals
under the influence of extraordinary excitement.
The billows roared tremendously, and
every dash of the sea against the dark and
frowning cliffs which beetled over the flood,
came rolling on like thunder. The convulsions
of the country rendered the storm awfully impressive;
the ear was held in fearful tension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
while uncertain sounds mingled in the blast like
shouts of human voices, approaching and receding,
rising and dying away again.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful night; but as no enemy
advanced, and imagination seemed more busy
than reality, in threatening danger, the family
retired a little later than usual to their several
apartments. When I reached mine, overcome
by the struggle of feelings which too often slumbered,
I threw myself into an old arm-chair near
the head of my bed, and would have given more
than I possessed, that tears such as I once could
shed, had come to my relief, but tears would not
flow.</p>

<p>"Good God," I exclaimed, "can this hardening
of the heart&mdash;this stifling of natural sympathies&mdash;this
close, secretive, frigid philosophy&mdash;be
the road to happiness? Are those who have
thrown off the ties of religion, and learned to
contemn the commandments of their Creator, in
the path of peace and virtue?"</p>

<p>These and other self-directed questions were
put to my heart in the stillness of solitary examination,
and the answer of conscience appalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
me. I prostrated myself on my knees, and I,
who would not give my parents the satisfaction
of thinking that I ever sent up a petition to
heaven, now fell instinctively into the language
of supplication, and broke into an agony of
prayer. A few minutes more, and I firmly believe
that I should have been found weeping on
my mother's neck. How she would have clasped
the penitent to her bosom! But in the very
instant when I was rising from the ground, the
door of my room was gently opened, and she
who had little reason to love or care for me,
urged by all that powerful impulse of maternal
solicitude which never sleeps, put in her head to
assure herself that her ungracious child was
safely protected by the shelter of his chamber
from the hurricane which denied her repose.</p>

<p>This unexpected apparition worked a sudden
revolution in my feelings. Ashamed and mortified
at having been caught in a posture of humiliation,
my wretched pride regained its empire,
and I rudely inquired of my mother what
she wanted.</p>

<p>"Only to see that you were here, Albert;
God bless you," was her soft reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>She closed the door, and my contrition was
at an end; the yearnings of returning affection
were given to the winds, and locking my door
with an angry violence, which I intended
should say, "I will not again suffer such intrusion,"
I extinguished my candle in a rage, and
plunged into my bed, but not to rest. To sleep
was not so easy; the storm increased every moment,
and though I had never been wanting
in the animal boldness called courage, I had a
chill at heart that night as if the phials of
Almighty wrath were pouring out upon a
guilty world, and the judgment of God preparing
punishment for the wicked.</p>

<p>In spite of all the sophistry with which my
tongue had become familiar, conscience was
not silenced, but forced the reluctant confession,
that my associates and I were mischievously
engaged in aiding a rebellion which would probably
terminate in much bloodshed and misery,
while <i>true</i> patriotism was the last motive that
influenced our conduct. The fact was, that
like all agitators we were impelled by motives
as various as the several characters on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
they operated, and were kept together by an
imaginary bond to which, for the convenience
of compact, we gave a name very foreign from
our real purposes, and in reality little connected
with the welfare of our country. I knew even
at the time when I was most closely leagued
with the Talbots and Lovetts, that they were
both selfish and violent. These young men governed
the rest of our confederacy with despotic
sway, to which, with all our boasted independence,
we implicitly submitted.</p>

<p>Thus are we cajoled in every stage of our existence.
Perpetually deceiving ourselves, we
applaud or revile not the principle but its application,
and the same conduct which is the
theme of our reprobation becomes that of our
praise and adoption, when happening to chime
in with our prejudices or our wishes.</p>

<p>I was in a musing vein, and notwithstanding
the riot of conflicting elements abroad, I lay
pondering mournfully and restlessly, when my
cogitations were interrupted by a gun. I started
up, and by the time that I groped my way to
the lobby, I found the whole family assembled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
My mother stood in a listening attitude, holding
a little lamp, which she always kept burning at
night, in her hand, and ere we had time to interchange
a sentence, the sound of a second
shot put an end to all uncertainty, and the
only point left to conjecture was the cause of this
firing. Some thought that we were going to be
invaded by a rebel party, while others feared
that a ship had foundered in the bay.</p>

<p>As the latter belief preponderated, it was suggested
that we should instantly sally forth to the
cliffs, and try whether it might not be possible
to render assistance to the sufferers. Here was
a crisis which broke through the reserve which
had become habitual amongst us, by one of
those forcible appeals to humanity that bear
down whatever is not in unison with their own
prompt and virtuous impulse. All memory of
bitterness was now suspended in the common
interest excited by the occasion.</p>

<p>Reader, have you ever known the unaccountable
perverseness of a stubborn soul, in the pride
of unsubdued passion, resolved to be miserable
rather than abate a high spirit, though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
longed, with gasping impatience, for any event
which, without your own intervention, might
place you once more at ease with those whom
you had offended? If you have, my sensations
at this moment will not seem strange to you. I
had not expressed any sorrow for the past, nor
lowered my dignity by any promise of amendment
for the future; yet here I was on a sudden,
running to and fro, and talking familiarly with
father, mother, brothers, and sisters, as if harmony
had never been disturbed. Those, on
the other hand, who have never experienced
the perversion of mind of which I am giving a
history, will find it difficult to comprehend how
this hour of dismay and anxiety should have
been the happiest which I had known for a long
time, resembling what a man feels on the removal
of a burthen which had pressed with
intolerable weight on every muscle of his frame.</p>

<p>An old Scotchman, who had grown grey in
our service, was one of the first who appeared
in the group, and lighting a candle, which he
put into the great stable-lanthorn, he called
Harold, Charles, and me, to accompany him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Away we flew, and many minutes did not elapse
before we reached the steepest part of the headland
which overhung our bay.</p>

<p>What a scene presented itself! The rain
had ceased, but it blew a perfect hurricane; the
scud drove furiously across the sky, while now
and then the broken beams of an angry moon
darted on the ocean a wild and scattered light
from under dense masses of the blackest clouds,
which sped athwart the heavens as if bent on
some message of destruction; the waves rolled
mountains high, and dashed with wild impetuosity
upon the rocks, roaring in thunder as they
approached the shore. Gun after gun was fired,
but at such a distance that we despaired of being
useful. We knew not how or whither to direct
our efforts, but stood close together, trying to
resist the force of the tempest, and endeavouring
to catch any sound that might guide us to the
scene of distress, when the shriek of a female
voice, borne distinctly upon the blast, afforded
dreadful assurance of shipwreck near at hand.
The cries were repeated with increased agony,
and were louder or fainter as the wind rose or
fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>With one accord we hurried down the rocks
as fast as the irregular crags over which we had
to scramble would permit. As we descended,
a fearful scream of anguish met our ears, after
which we heard no more. All but the raging
of the storm then died away, and by the time
that we reached the bottom of the cliff no sound
of human woe mingled in the gale.</p>

<p>A poor fisherman and his family lived at a
little distance in a cavity amongst the rocks,
and thither we next directed our steps. I was
the first to gain this miserable hut, the door of
which I found wide open, swinging to and fro
on its crazy hinges. We called aloud to Kelly,
his wife, and sons, but received no answer.
M'Farlane, the old Scotchman, proposed that
we should go farther down along the shore to a
little creek, in which Kelly's boat was usually
moored. When arrived at the spot, there was
no boat there. We hallooed again, but in
vain; no living being seemed within hearing;
all was silent save the winds and waves. As the
tide was rapidly retiring we groped along the
sands, holding the lanthorn close to the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and searching, as carefully as its uncertain glimmer
would allow, for any vestige of the wreck,
which we concluded that day-light would but
too fully exhibit.</p>

<p>While thus employed, Harold's foot struck
against something soft which, on examination,
proved to be a small spaniel with a collar round
its neck. The poor animal was quite dead, and
holding it up to the light, we read the name of
Henry Talbot. The shock of this discovery
was indescribable. A thousand vague, yet terrible
surmises rushed upon my imagination,
and before we were able to retrace our path to
Kelly's hut, where we determined to wait the
break of day, an oar over which I stumbled,
and which we found branded at one end with
the letters D. K. afforded awful conviction that
a dreadful catastrophe had involved the unfortunate
fisherman, and perhaps others, in a
watery grave.</p>

<p>We took up the oar on our shoulders, and on
reaching Kelly's cabin, which had been empty
when we first visited it, we were not a little surprised
to find his wife lying flat without signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
life upon the clay floor. We raised her, and
perceiving that she was not dead, placed her
gently on the wretched trestle, which, covered
with straw, and a blanket, served for a bed in
this lowly habitation; and taking the candle
from our lanthorn lighted a few dry sticks which
were piled in a corner. We then removed
poor Norah to the fire, took off her old water-soaked
cloak, and began to rub her hands and
feet with all our strength. We discovered a
bundle of rushes too, which having been dipped
in grease, serve the poor Irish in place of candles,
and were glad to avail ourselves of their
feeble aid, not only for presenting some sort of
beacon to any vessel which might be nearing the
rocks, but also to assist our search for any thing
with which to moisten the lips of the dying
woman.</p>

<p>At length I discovered a bottle which held a
remainder drop of whisky, and seizing on this
treasure, we hastened to try its life-restoring
powers on our patient. While my brothers
and I were thus busily occupied, M'Farlane
drew from the corner cupboard, in which I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
found the bottle, a small bit of soiled paper
folded up, on which, when opened, the following
words appeared written in <i>printing</i> characters,
apparently for the purpose of disguising the
hand that traced them.</p>

<p>"Be sure not to fail us. You know the place,
and the hour. A vessel will lie to, off the Bay.
Let nothing tempt you to betray him. A better
reward than money will crown fidelity. Finish
the good work which you have begun. I depend
also on Norah and the boys. If we succeed
in getting <i>him</i> safely out of the country, all
will be well. She will see him on board, which
I am sorry for, as the weather is unpromising.
We must land at the Black Point, after doing
our job. This goes by a sure hand. Be prepared
early; read, and burn.</p>

<p>
"Yours, truly &mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>"Hah, hah!" cried M'Farlane. "I see
plainly enough now how it is. Here is a plot,
and the plotters are taken in their own snare.
A heavy judgment from Heaven is come upon
them."</p>

<p>I sprang towards him, and snatched the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
from his hand, anxious to prevent him from getting
hold of information not intended for him;
but he had read all the contents; and though
there was neither name nor date to apprise us of
the actors, it was plain enough that Kelly and
his sons had been employed with their boat to
convey some mysterious personage from the
coast; while it was equally manifest that the
writer of the billet, whoever he might be, and
the female to whom he alluded, designed to return,
after executing their trust, and placing
their charge securely on board a vessel ready to
steer, in all probability, for France or America.</p>

<p>M'Farlane could never be induced to take
part in any of our schemes, and had lavished
much useless advice to deter me and my brothers
from joining in what he called "the wicked folly
of the times." He was hence a person of whom
we stood in some awe, and with whom we held
very little communion, considering him, as we
did, no better than a spy; and I felt exceedingly
vexed and annoyed at his having been set on
spelling and putting together these few dark
words, which told sufficient to excite curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned and twisted the paper which had
been crumpled up, and was probably reserved
for lighting Kelly's pipe, in performing which
office, the poor fellow seemed to think it would
be time enough to obey the injunctions of his
correspondent by destroying it. The words already
noticed were written with pen and ink,
but on minuter scrutiny, I deciphered on the
outside, scrawled with a pencil, and nearly illegible,
a sentence which was apparently designed
as a postscript to the note.</p>

<p>"Take care, and let not a syllable escape
your lips <i>up the hill</i>. Many matters now afloat,
must be kept secret from <i>that quarter</i>."</p>

<p>What is the meaning, thought I to myself, of
"up the hill?" and it instantly flashed across
my mind, that Glendruid was the place indicated
by this expression, and that I was one of those
to be kept in the dark respecting all proceedings.
We who had toiled early and late, sacrificed
food and rest, frequently hazarded life and
liberty; and spent every shilling which we could
command, were to be treated as aliens, as enemies!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Is this gratitude? exclaimed I. I hastily resolved
to separate myself immediately from men
thus undeserving of confidence; such treachery
was intolerable, and I longed for an opportunity
of resenting it, though caution would be necessary,
lest I might injure my cause with Albinia
by renouncing all future league with her brothers.
My resolution was not the result of good
feeling, it was only the effervescence of sudden
indignation, and events succeeded which
prevented its practical steadiness from being
brought to the test.</p>

<p>During the short interval in which I was engaged
by these reflections, my brothers continued
their efforts to revive the cold-stricken
Norah. After many fruitless efforts, they at
length accomplished their object. A few drops
of the cordial whisky were swallowed, and in a
little time she opened her eyes, which she rolled
wildly round, and starting from her bed, shrieked
aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh Dan a Vourneen, where are you?
Where is Jack? Where is Timsey?"</p>

<p>Her eyes lighting on <i>our</i> faces, not those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
her husband and children, she relapsed into
another swoon, long and deep, from which we
had great difficulty in recovering her.</p>

<p>At last she sat up, and clasped her sun-burned
hands together in an agony of grief, rocking her
body backwards and forwards to a piteous wail,
which the Irish call Ullagone; the dirge music
in which they mourn their dead. She gave no
answer to our entreaties that she would try and
compose herself. In vain did we inquire what
had happened, and ask how we could possibly
afford her any relief. She did not reply to a
single question, but rolling her tearless eyes in
their sockets, staring now at one of us, and
then at another, but without appearing to take
notice of any, the hapless creature continued
her melancholy howl, beating her breast and
tearing her hair.</p>

<p>At the expiration of an hour's ineffectual
effort to obtain the slightest information from
Norah, we determined on removing her from a
scene so dreadful as that of her now lonely
abode, leaving M'Farlane behind to watch
the fire till our return. Just as we were going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to take Norah from her cabin, the sagacious
Scotchman bethought him of an expedient which
operated like magic on the wretched mourner.
He recollected the national superstition, and exclaimed,
in an expostulatory tone, "Oh then, is
it like a fond wife or mother, to say, that you'd
let their ghosts roam for ever and ever, without
rest or quiet, rather than tell where we might
look for the bodies, and bury 'em like Christians?"</p>

<p>This idea roused Norah's torpid senses. She
started as if she had been shot, and would have
rushed out of the house, if we had not fastened
the door in the instant that she was about to dart
through it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Norah," said the persevering Scot,
"they will wander, and be unhappy, if you do
not tell all you know, and let us try and find
them, that they may be <i>waked</i> properly, and
buried with their people."</p>

<p>"God bless you; God bless you;" reiterated
the frenzied Norah; "Go to the Black Pint;
och, 'tis the Black Pint."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"What took them to the Black Point at this
unseasonable hour, and in such a storm?"</p>

<p>"What else but the boat, gramachree," answered
Norah.</p>

<p>"What were they doing in such weather as
this?"</p>

<p>"Fishen, dear, fishen," was the poor creature's
lying answer.</p>

<p>"No, that is impossible, Norah," said I; "you
must not deceive those who would befriend you.
Dan Kelly knew too well when it was coming
on to blow hard. He would not venture his
own life or that of his sons in such a night as
this. It is no fishing time. Tell what you can
of the affair and every help shall be given you."</p>

<p>"I knows nauthen, asthore. For the honour
o' God, dear, ax me no more, for I can't tell any
thin but only that they war strugglen home agin
the tide, and were maken straight for Black
Pint when a big wave (oh then, oh then, oh
then!) hised away the boat and capsized it.
There's no more to be tould, only my darlens
is gone, holy Mary mark 'em to glory, and 'tis
I that's dissolit to day." Norah wept bitterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as she uttered these words. I besought her to
tell me who, beside her husband and sons, had
been buffeting the billows in the boat on that
awful night.</p>

<p>"How does your honour think I can tell!
'Tis enough for me, that them that's gone, <i>is</i>
gone. Oh! cuishla machree, Timsey, my darlen
of all my darlens."</p>

<p>Mac Farlane, perceiving that I made no great
way in my catechism, brought forward the little
dog, which had lain by in a dark corner of the
cabin, and carelessly turning it with his foot,
said, in a soliloquizing manner, "Poor little
brute! you are more lucky than your master.
He is gone, to be sure, with the rest of 'em, and
will be without christian burial too, while you
will be laid in the ground as if you had a soul
to be saved. I wonder, Mr. Albert, whether
the party in the boat were lost before they
reached the ship, or whether they ever were
able to put the stranger on board." Norah
had not till now seen either the oar or the dead
dog, and fell into the most extravagant lamentations
at sight of them. Terrified at finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
M'Farlane, as she now believed, in the secret,
she fell on her knees, and in a tone of the most
earnest supplication entreated that he would
not divulge a single particular.</p>

<p>"Some of 'em may be alive yet. May be all
wouldn't be drownded, and if they war, the
sperrets o' the dead, Misther Mickfaarlin,
would never laive you alone if you spaik. Oh!
Sir, and the widdy's blessen on you, don't be
villeefyen them that's gone. Laive 'em quite
any way, for they've enough to trouble 'em
without <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't harm the dead, woman," said
M'Farlane, "any more than you. 'Tis a pitiful
case. Only tell his name, and her name
who was with him, and your fortune is as good
as made. If you speak truth, my master will
send an account of it all to the castle o' Dublin,
and you'll be sure of a purse o' gold that will
keep you in comfort for the rest o' your life."</p>

<p>"I'll tell nauthen but what you know," replied
the sobbing Norah; "and there's no use
in axing me, for I'll die before I tells upon 'em.
What do I want of cumfurt now? If money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
would make tell-tales of any that lived in this
cabin, as poor as it is, would'nt we be riden in
a coche and six long ago fur spaiken plain, but
though they're down in the salt sai, I'll not fret
'em, I'll hould my tongue, and Misther Mickfaarlin,
if you war'nt a sassenah (no offence, Sir),
you would'nt be the one to turn the harts o'the
dead frum me. Oh then! oh then! a wee-nough
Dan, and Tom, and Timsey asthore!
If 'tis a thing that they braiks every bone in my
body, or cuts out my tongue, they'll get no
good o' me, for the sorra a word I'll spaik, no
more than the dead himself."</p>

<p>No cunning of M'Farlane's could elicit
farther, and though so strongly prompted by
curiosity, which triumphed over every other
feeling, that I had endeavoured myself to come
at the bottom of the melancholy tale, I admired
the noble devotedness of this affectionate woman,
upon whom no sordid motive had the slightest
influence. She would willingly have laid down
her life, rather than betray the cause to which
she had sworn fealty. Oh! how the generous
heroism of poor Norah, and her enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
fidelity even to the shades of those who had
been dear to her, put to shame all who, without
a spark of disinterested zeal, first involved,
and then abandoned a people, many of whom
gave proofs like this of the tenderest and most
unselfish attachment. Norah, suddenly recollecting
that the removal of the dog might damp
the spirit of investigation, seized a spade which
stood in the hut against the wall, and turning
up the clay floor within the hurdle which served
as a partition between the outer division of her
hut, and the interior where she slept, deposited
the little animal, collar and all, filling the hole,
and stamping the ground with her feet to make
all smooth as it was before. In this labour of
love towards the memory of the departed, her
grief seemed forgotten in her anxiety to conceal
whatever might injure any survivor whose cause
her husband and children had espoused.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>We succeeded at length in detaching Norah
from the scene of her loss, and having left her in
the care of my sisters, we repaired again with
the dawn to the beach, which we diligently
searched for miles along the shore, and found
covered with mounds of oar-weed-timber, rope
ends, and other indications of the last night's
storm. A weather-beaten hat, which bore no
mark to ascertain who had been its owner, was
all that we picked up which told that human
being had been on the seas that night.</p>

<p>The kindest attention was shewn at Glendruid
to the unhappy Norah, and as she continued
to persist in pleading ignorance of every
thing beyond the misfortune which deprived
her of all she loved on earth, she was spared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
after the first examination. But the "hundred
tongues of rumour," were soon unbound.</p>

<p>In the course of the following day, a report
was industriously circulated that Albinia Talbot
and Richard Lovett had gone off upon a matrimonial
adventure to Gretna Green. The two
families affected to be much displeased; and as
their consternation was sincere, though not proceeding
from the alledged cause, they were
enabled to act their part with specious appearance.
On pretence of being severely
shocked by the event, access was denied to
visitors both at Painesville and Ferney, so that
all communication was suspended for the
present moment. My father, however, though
not in the habit of calling at either house, conceived
himself called upon as a pastor to offer
kind condolence, if he could do no more, and
on the third day after the reported elopement,
he set out on a ride over the mountain to try
whether he might not be able to mitigate the
wrath which he heard had been excited against
the young people, and prevail with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
respective families to forgive an act which could
not be recalled.</p>

<p>His road lay through Ballymaclashen, where
there was a post office at M'Carthy's public
house, which he was to pass, and calling for letters,
he was presented with an enormous government
packet, filled with printed proclamations,
which were forwarded to him from the castle,
with an official requisition to have them posted
in the most conspicuous situations. These
printed papers, minutely described by name,
dress, and personal appearance, the very young
man whom I knew to be my brother Harold's
dearest friend and ally, offering a large reward
for his apprehension, and stating that he was
known to have taken refuge in our mountains,
from whence it was supposed that he meant to
escape across the seas. My father read the
proclamation aloud at the chapel door, as well
as that of the church, and ordered the old sexton
to get some wafers and stick up the notices
throughout this village. Imagining that this
new circumstance might throw some light on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the story of the Gretna fugitives, he hastened
his steed and pushed forward towards Ferney.</p>

<p>When arrived at Mr. Talbot's, he learned
that on the preceding morning, before daylight,
the whole family had set off to Dublin in the
greatest speed to try and overtake their daughter.
This intelligence was received from a cowherd,
who seemed the only person left about the
place, and my father having expressed his concern
that any thing should have occurred to
give pain to his neighbours, added a hope that
the young gentlemen were all safe.</p>

<p>"We have been uneasy," said he, "lest any
fatal accident had happened on Tuesday night,
when Mr. Henry's dog, you know, was found
at Glendruid. We all feared that he might
have been in poor Dan Kelly's boat, when he
and his sons were drowned."</p>

<p>"Och no! for what I know they're all safe
enough," answered the cowherd: "Croppy follied
Dick Lovett, who lost him as he was comen
home, and the dog was swamped, they say,
among the rocks."</p>

<p>"Good day to you then," said my father; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
shall call and ask how the family at Painesville
are this morning."</p>

<p>"You may spare yourself that throuble, Sir,"
rejoined Bat Higgins; "all the Lovetts are gone
full cry afther the young couple to some place
in Scotland; I think where they say that a
blacksmidth is all as one as the clargy, and
buckles the people as tight as the best of 'em."</p>

<p>As it was growing late, and the country had
long been unquiet, my father, fearful of alarming
my mother by being out after sunset, turned
his horse into the homeward path, little pleased
with the gruff, unceremonious manners of the
cowherd, and pondered the altered style of the
peasantry, and the mysterious departure of his
neighbours, as he rode along. In passing again
through Ballymaclashen he found that the proclamations
were all torn down, in the short period
of his absence. He inquired, but could
not learn who had shown such disrespect to
Government and to him; and observing a sullen
uncivil deportment in the people, who neither
touched their hats, nor said a courteous word as
they had been wont to do, he thought it prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to advance without irritating them by farther
interrogations; so, sighing as he ascended the
heathy barrier which lay between the village
and his once cheerful home, he ruminated, as he
said, on his return, upon the evil days, which it
was God's will that he should encounter, and
prayed for a divine blessing to sustain him
against whatever ills might be yet in store.</p>

<p>As he wound down a rocky pathway, lying
between gigantic stones, loosely piled together
so as to form a sort of rude wall on either side,
a man suddenly glided from behind, and seized
his horse's bridle. My father was unarmed, and
supposing the person who stopped him to be
one of a gang, determined on his destruction,
believed his last moment to be at hand; but ere
he had power to speak, the man, first looking
affectionately at him, and next casting a hasty
glance all round, to make sure that he was not
observed, whispered softly the following words,
as rapidly as possible:</p>

<p>"Plase your Riverence, dont be angry to me
for stoppen ye. 'Tis to do ye a good turn, for
myself does be in danger of limb and life while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
I am spaiken; but sure 'twas you and yours that
often kep me and mine from starvation, when
we were all lien down togither, in the agee, and
why would I see a hair of your Rivirence's head
hurted if I could help myself? These are bad
times, and your sons ought to take care o' themselves.
May be they might be afther knowen
more about the boat that was racked the other
night, and consarnen them papers too, in your
Rivirence's hand, than they ought to do for
their own safety and yours. Take the warnen,
and God bless your Honour's Rivirence, and
never tell to man or mortial who tould you this
much, though sure in the main time I tould
you nothen at all that would bring any one into
throuble. I'd scorn <i>that</i> any how!"</p>

<p>So saying, the apparition vanished, and was
out of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>My father, as may be concluded, returned
home in great agitation. We sat down to dinner,
and immediately after the cloth was removed,
he detailed the particulars which I have related
in the presence of my mother and sisters; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
making a solemn appeal to our sincerity, calmly
and affectingly called upon my brothers and me,
by all that we held most sacred, to reveal truly
and without prevarication, all that we knew respecting
the events of Tuesday night. It happened,
as I have already stated, that though
deeply implicated in other matters, we were
really ignorant of this sad story, and not thinking
it necessary to volunteer in answering to any
thing beyond the scope of the precise interrogatory,
we replied with that degree of boldness
and promptitude which bespeaks truth, that we
were not acquainted with a single circumstance
relating to the catastrophe of the storm, which
was not equally known to all the country, and
as to the proclamations, we had never heard of
their contents till my father brought them home,
and could not afford any clue to the discovery
of the person sought for.</p>

<p>When we had given this assurance, my mother,
in tears, threw her arms about our necks,
and I shall never forget the thrilling tenderness
with which she exclaimed, "My beloved children,
let the dangers by which we are encompassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
be a bond of union amongst us&mdash;let the warnings
of this day teach us wisdom&mdash;let domestic
love bless our family circle&mdash;and let us pray earnestly
for the protection of Him who can alone
guard us through the perils which seem to beset
our path. If happiness and peace be in store
for us, will they not be doubly enjoyed in concert?
If misfortune be our doom, what care or
sorrow is not alleviated by sympathy?"</p>

<p>Alas! I <i>suffered</i> my mother's embrace. I
did not repay it; and from the cold demeanour
of Harold and Charles, it appeared that her
maternal affection met with no kinder reception
from them. We were metamorphosed by the
spirit of the <i>Times</i>, and pride would not permit
even a tacit acknowledgment that we had been
in the wrong. A retractation of the opinion
which had been adopted in our school would
have been considered unpardonable weakness.
My mother looked chilled to the heart. Her
fond love was repelled, and the returned tide
seemed almost to deprive her of breath. Yet
she upbraided not, but shook her head in silence.
My father said something to which I paid little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
attention, and the group dispersed as was their
usual custom.</p>

<p>The stimulus of late events began to wear off.
Day after day glided by in gloomy stillness,
rendered oppressive by the anxiety which was
common to us all. The dark reports in circulation&mdash;the
mysterious departure of the Talbots
and Lovetts, perplexed us painfully. Yet, at
the present juncture, to have indulged curiosity
by taking such steps as might lead to information,
was full of peril, and the restraint which
we found it necessary to impose upon ourselves
became intolerable. I had an additional torment
to endure, which was exclusively my own,
and I suffered the most intense mortification
which wounded self-love could experience.</p>

<p>Jealousy was a strong feature of my character.
I had attached myself with enthusiasm to Albinia
Talbot, and now felt roused like a lion
from its den, and could find no solace except
in perpetually wandering along the shore, and
gazing on the ocean, as if I expected that the
waves of the sea would speak and divulge all
that I desired to learn. A sort of invincible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
attraction led me continually to the cliffs, there
to muse on the faithless Albinia. It was certain
that, under other circumstances than those
in which I had been placed, she would not have
been the goddess of my adoration. Her beauty
was dazzling, but it wanted softness. She might
have represented Bellona, and seemed formed
to command&mdash;to conquer&mdash;but with the gentle
graces of female loveliness Albinia had no relation.
The limited circle however of my acquaintance
afforded very slender means of comparison,
and imagination supplied all that reality
denied to decorate the object of my devotion
with perfections which only exist in the Poet's
dream.</p>

<p>I made verses, and used to "mar every tree"
with writing love-songs in their bark. The
name of Albinia had mounted on every breeze,
and was returned by the echoes of our caverned
beach. I had never, it is true, <i>told</i> my love, and
had therefore no right to conclude that it was
reciprocal; but youth is full of confidence and
credulity. Albinia's manners were abrupt, but
then she was a <i>patriot</i>, and her mind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
engrossed by the wrongs of her country. "When
the public ferment subsides," thought I, "will
be fit time for disclosing my sentiments. I
shall then,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; <small>tell my tale</small><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><small>Under the hawthorn in the vale</small>,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and no doubt be favourably received." In the
mean time I excused all the coldness, rudeness,
and undutifulness of my own conduct at home
on the plea of this delirium of my brain. I
dignified the exclusive surrender of my affection
to Miss Talbot by the character of <i>concentration</i>,
and rather piqued myself upon being savage to
all beside.</p>

<p>"Great souls," said I, "disdain the paltry
interchange of mere civility and benevolence.
They soar above such tame observances, and refusing
to be bound by the slavish ties of kindred&mdash;love
and hate <i>grandly</i>."</p>

<p>How little did I then know of that ennobling
passion, which softens and refines while it occupies
the heart&mdash;or reflect that brutality to parents,
and neglect of sisters, evinced the spurious
nature of my attachment for Albinia!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
But could it be possible that this queen of my
homage&mdash;this theme of my muse&mdash;this idol of my
devotion; she who nerved my arm to anticipated
deeds of glory&mdash;who absorbed my thoughts
by day, and stole upon my nightly visions, had
eloped with the unpoetical Richard Lovett, who
had nothing but a handsome face and form to
recommend him; Lovett, who had never held
a "descant to the moon," nor breathed a "sonnet
to a lady's eye-brow." Unheedful of my
feelings, ungrateful for my worship, had Albinia
laughed at my woes, and deceived my penetration?</p>

<p>Fevered by these questions which I could
not solve, I used to seek the cooling zephyrs
from the bay, and withdraw from the scrutinizing
observation of my father and mother, who
were, I remarked, at this time anxiously watching
the post in expectation of letters; but I
was too much engrossed by my own affairs to
make inquiry, or feel any solicitude which did
not come home to self.</p>

<p>It was just a fortnight after the fatal hurricane,
when one grey and lowering morning I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
sought my usual haunt, and hastened after
breakfast to leave the house, and brood over my
misfortunes in the solitude of my favourite cave,
amongst the rocks. As I sat, more than commonly
depressed, "chewing the cud of sweet
and bitter fancy," and like all selfish natures
believing that my lot was marked by peculiar
and unmerited severity&mdash;that I was decreed by
fate, or providence, or whatever power ruled
the destinies of men, to suffer more than any of
my fellow beings; I wasted many precious moments
in angry repinings, while a volume of
Homer, which I never opened, lay at my side,
to give me an air of occupation should I be
surprised in my retreat. I gazed vacantly on
the sea, and know not how long my reverie
might have wrapped every sense in forgetfulness
of passing time, if my attention had not
been caught by some unusual appearance floating
on the surface of the water. At first I took
it for a mass of oar-weed, but as it approached
the shore a vague apprehension crossed my mind
that it was a human form; and, hastily descending
the rocks, I watched with breathless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
emotion till the tide washed it slowly into the creek,
directly beneath my feet. What language is
capable of conveying, even in the faintest degree,
an idea of the horror which thrilled through
my frame at the sight of Albinia Talbot so
changed, so disfigured, that her dress alone proclaimed
her identity!</p>

<p>I grew sick, and staggered unconsciously to a
projecting point of the cliff, for support. My
head seemed to turn round, my sight failed me;
and fully a quarter of an hour elapsed before I
recovered my senses sufficiently to make farther
examination. At last I ventured once more to
approach the body, round which the well known
green habit, her beautiful hair, and the tangled
sea weed, interlaced, to form Albinia's shroud.
So terrible to the mind of man is the awful
transformation wrought by death, that a cold
dew crept over me as I attempted to clear away
the sedge from features so lately lighted up by
the fire of health and animation. Good God,
what a spectacle was unfolded to my view!</p>

<p>But I will arrest the shocking description,
and not press on any other memory than my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
own that appalling recollection which will only
be erased with my latest breath. As I took a
half averted glance at the deceased object of my
affection, I perceived a ribbon which passed
round the neck, and to which some trinket appeared
to be suspended. I disengaged the band
with desperate resolution, and pulling it from
the habit which adhered closely to poor Albinia's
breast, drew out a small flat enameled case,
which opened with a spring. A ring, swivel-seal,
and little piece of folded paper, fell upon
the ground. I hastily collected these reliques,
and retiring from the water's edge, hid myself
behind the rocks to examine them more attentively.</p>

<p>The ring was of gold, with a plait of hair, and
the letter P. carefully concealed within a simple
hoop. The seal was of a beautiful Irish amethyst,
and finely engraved; its device, Hibernia
dashing down a crown with one hand, and receiving
a dagger from heaven with the other,
while a harp, with some of its strings broken,
stood by her. On unfolding the paper which
had on one side two or three monograms, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
alphabet in cipher, I read on the other the following
words, in an unknown and apparently
feigned hand writing: "I hope that you will
not be mad enough to think of seeing me on
board the&mdash;&mdash;. The weather is threatening,
and the sea-faring people expect a gale. I implore
you to beware of risking your safety. I
send you the <i>key</i>. Give the ring which accompanies
it to Ladhor. You will forward the seal
according to our arrangement. Farewell. I
trust that ere long we shall meet again. Though
clouds may occasionally obscure the horizon of
our hopes, the cause in which we are engaged
must finally triumph."</p>

<p>The whole mystery appeared now unravelled.
The possession of that seal which I knew to be
the one used in sealing the rebel despatches sent
to France, marked a <i>chief</i>, and I had no doubt
that it was consigned to Albinia's care by the
person described in the late proclamation. I
discovered him also to be no other than the
friend of my eldest brother, by decyphering the
name of Harold in the transposition of the
letters which formed Ladhor. It also seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
evident that the necessity for rapid flight had
prevented my brother from either meeting or
hearing from his friend, whom, by the bye, I
had never seen, and who it would appear, had
in some accidental manner met with Albinia,
and entrusted her with these commissions, to be
executed after his departure.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the melancholy truth, and
the Gretna-green expedition was a mere feint,
to cover the mournful reality, and prevent suspicion
from attaching to the families of Ferney
and Painesville. Whether Richard Lovett had
been on board the boat or not, seemed uncertain,
but whoever accompanied the ill-fated Albinia
had probably shared her sorrowful fate. The
object had plainly been to put a rebel leader
safely out of the reach of those emissaries who
were endeavouring to apprehend him, and those
strenuous partizans in the cause of freedom
had lost their lives in accomplishing the enterprize.</p>

<p>My jealousy was now for ever hushed to
sleep. Alas! had I not been enabled to explain
the conduct of her who had excited it, the sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
on which my eyes had rested, furnished an all-powerful
remedy for the passion which had been
an inmate of my bosom. I have since learned
by experience, that the tenderest affection may
survive, after the tomb has closed upon those
beings most dear to our souls; but the hand of
death, in common cases, deals gently with our
sorrows, and casts a veil over the objects of
whom he deprives us ere yet the living memory
of the beloved form is impaired. No love could
stand the test by which mine was now tried;
nor outlive the shock which it had just sustained.
No impression remained to mingle with my pity
except that of horror and amazement. I lingered
for some time, unable to remove myself
from the scene which had nearly deprived me
of power to exert a muscle. At length I
wrapped up the enamel-case, and its contents, in
my handkerchief, which, putting into my pocket,
I resolved to keep secret. If I spoke of finding
these things, I should be obliged to bring them
forward at an inquest. I therefore determined
to mention the body only, without farther particulars,
and at a distant day I might contrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
some unsuspected mode of conveying the ring,
which was his property, to Harold.</p>

<p>My next step was to place a great stone on
the extremity of poor Albinia's outer garment,
to secure the corpse from being carried out
again to sea with the ebbing tide. After this
precaution, I ran as quickly as I could; pale
and faint; to tell my story at the house.</p>

<p>My father lost no time in taking measures
for the usual form of inquiry, but no witnesses
appeared to give additional information. "Accidental
death" was returned by the coroner;
and poor Albinia's earthly remains were attended
to the grave by all the family of Glendruid,
who, in this act of tender feeling towards
the dead, forgot how little they had ever approved
her living conduct. Norah was a principal
figure in the melancholy procession, and
bewailed her misfortunes afresh; but as nothing
appeared to contradict the story of a clandestine
union, the rumour still maintained its
ground, and it was conjectured that the parties,
desirous to elude pursuit, instead of proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
directly by land, intended to cross the bay, and
make their way through bye roads to Dublin.</p>

<p>The political ferment was daily increasing,
and indications of rebellion were continually
alarming the well affected.</p>

<p>In about a week after the funeral of Albinia,
a packet of letters arrived one morning by the
bare-footed messenger who acted as post-boy
at Glendruid. As my father had written to
Mr. Talbot informing him of all that had happened,
directing his letter to Dublin, on the
chance of its reaching its destination, I thought
it probable that the packet just arrived might be
from my Ferney friends, and loitered accordingly
in the room where we had breakfasted,
hoping to hear some tidings of the absentees.</p>

<p>None being communicated, however, I stole
away as usual to the sea side. My heart was
dreadfully oppressed. Restless and aspiring by
nature, I had no means of gratifying either my
activity or my ambition. The transient dream
of love which had filled my imagination, and
furnished materials for many an air-built castle,
which served to beguile the passing hours, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
vanished. The blank which my mind experienced
was insupportable. I would willingly
have done any thing to change the scene, and
give a new current to my thoughts. I envied
the weather-beaten ploughman who toiled for his
daily bread, and would gladly have engaged in
the most laborious occupation which might detach
my memory from recent events. The
spectre of Albinia, arrayed in all the horrors of
the deep, was present everywhere; and the particulars
of that frightful picture disturbed my
sleep. I could not read; if I fixed my eyes
but for a moment on a book, I found them
wandering; and if I compelled myself to finish
a page, I had no impression of its contents, on
which the outward sense had only been employed,
while attention strayed and resisted all
control. Sadly and listlessly lounging in my
rocky recess, I heard M'Farlane's voice calling
my name. I started up, and advancing to
meet him, was informed that my father and
mother had gone to the Glyn, whither they desired
that I should follow.</p>

<p>I felt little satisfaction in obeying this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
summons, conscious as I was of not meriting any
agreeable communication at the meeting, and
always fearful of scrutiny into my conduct.</p>

<p>What misery is the portion of those who quit
the path of duty! but I made no such comment
<i>then</i>, though I practically experienced its truth,
and writhed under its influence.</p>

<p>When I reached the rustic seat in the Glyn,
where my parents awaited my coming, a mingled
sensation of sullenness and shame produced
awkwardness on my part, the pain of
which I still remember. How beautiful the
youthful glow of artlessness and affection! I
could not look up, yet disdained to cast down
my eyes, and attempting to brave feelings which
I could not escape, sent round a furtive unmeaning
glance, which dared not rest on any
object, but spoke the perturbation of my soul,
while it affected the ease of indifference. My
mother's eyes were swollen with weeping, and
my father's cheek was blanched with inward
corrosion of heart.</p>

<p>"Albert," said he, "sit down, and listen to
a determination which concerns you. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
mother and I have resolved on accepting the
kind offer of your uncle, who long since desired
to have one of our sons sent to Quebec; but we
declined the proposal. There was a time in
which we fondly hoped to see our children provided
for nearer home. None of you wished
to engage in commerce, and your happiness"&mdash;here
my poor father's voice faltered&mdash;"having
ever been our dearest earthly object, you
were indulged at the expense of worldly prudence,
and I gratefully refused for you all, my
brother's kind invitation. Your uncle remonstrated;
censured my weakness; and foretold
that a day of repentance would come. Such a
day has arrived, but to propitiate a near and
dear relation who felt wounded by the rejection
of his services, appeared a difficult task. It was
very doubtful too, whether in times like these,
he would incur the hazard of taking into his
house a person of your age, who might not be
found easily trainable, and who might also, perhaps,
carry along with him the unwelcome contagion
of that fatal epidemic which is desolating
Ireland. The matter, however, is accomplished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
your mother has succeeded; the lot falls on you,
and we shall lose no time in making the necessary
preparations for your departure to Liverpool,
whence you are to embark for Canada. I
do not give you any option. You have ceased
to be a child, it is true, but you have acted too
like a mischievous one to be allowed any farther
latitude. We have no fortune. Our sons must
depend upon their own exertions for independence.
Though I fear that you care no longer
for our affection, you will nevertheless have our
prayers; and may He who alone can soften
your heart make you sensible of your errors, and
guide you in the paths of virtue."</p>

<p>My mother could not utter a word, but she
held her hand to me; I took, and pressed it
with some energy, but my sudden animation
was caused by the joy of seeing a prospect
opened for quitting home. This was truly
emancipation, let it come in what form it might,
as the breaking up of Painesville and Ferney
had destroyed the local interests, which I had
mistaken for a more comprehensive principle;
and the tragical termination of my romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
with poor Albinia, had left a chasm impossible
to be described. I hated the idea of being a
merchant, but the distant evil merged in the
present good. My fears for the future were undefined,
while the rapture of leaving Glendruid
was certain. Hope was soon busy in weaving a
gay tissue of things to come. The deep affront
which had been conveyed in the paper discovered
by Macfarlane, rankled in my breast, and
in fact had served to turn me from the party
who had acted with such dissimulation as disgusted
my self-love, though it had not the effect
of converting me to better views.</p>

<p>My uncle was a stranger to me; I had never
seen him, but he was accounted a sensible man.
No doubt he was a modern philosopher, or if
not, my eloquence would soon persuade him.
America was a soil in which the tree of liberty
already flourished. I should breathe an atmosphere
of inspiration, I should detail with all the
ardour of young enthusiasm those scenes which
I left behind, and paint with raptured glow the
noble struggle for freedom which was in progress.
Unfettered, unconstrained, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
revel in the wilds of intellectual expansion; and
if catching fire from the reflection of my own
fervor, I were to transgress the dull limits of
<i>mere fact</i>, and embellish my story in a good
cause, there would be no troublesome truth-teller
at hand to shake his head at me. Listening
crowds would admire, and my uncle, proud
of his nephew, would encourage the exhibition
of my powers. My fame would extend. It
would soon be discovered that talents like mine
were suited to higher purposes than penning
consignments of cotton and indigo; and that
my abilities were somewhat above the farrago
of "sugars dull, rums looking up, pimento
flat, coffees lively, tobacco smart," and all the
vulgar gibberish of trade. I should first be my
uncle's idol, next his heir, and conclude by performing
a conspicuous part when I returned
on the theatre of Europe.</p>

<p>These idle fantasies are tedious to record, but
passed with such rapidity through my mind,
that after a short pause, during which my silence
was perhaps attributed to contrition for the past,
I assured my parents of my entire willingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
to acquiesce in their plans; and arrangements
were immediately commenced.</p>

<p>Time, which had crept slothfully with me,
now trimmed his wing. My days were no
longer spent in moping along the beach, nor
my mind evaporized in fertile reverie; I was employed
from sun-rise to sun-set, in examining
maps, exploring Gazetteers, collecting whatever
newspapers and magazines I could find to aid
my future exploits in oratory, and making all
the preparation within my slender means for my
great <i>Hegira</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>At length the welcome day arrived, "big
with the fate of Cato and of Rome;" and on
a brilliant dawn, the sun shining brightly as
though in harmony with all mankind, did I bid
adieu to the home of my youth. I was not so
completely lost to every good feeling, as to take
leave of my mother without emotion. I could
not forgive my father for being a clergyman,
nor my sisters for not adopting my political
speculations, but my mother, that kindest
of mothers, was fading sensibly away. Her
sinking spirits and wasted form, bespoke a saddened
soul; and when I felt her tears bedew
my cheek, something like affection glowed at
my heart, and I embraced her with a transient
gleam of contrite tenderness.</p>

<p>Oh! could I have foreseen that I should
never behold that face again, perhaps my obdurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
nature would have yielded to the softening
influence of maternal love; but I broke through
the scene, and hurried forward.</p>

<p>I was to cross the Bay, and embark in a little
boat from the Black Point of stormy memory.
Though I traversed the waters in the same direction
which had been fatal to that unfortunate
little band, not one of whom it was supposed
had survived to relate the terrors of a night
which had exchanged for them the warm realities
of this busy world for the "cold obstruction"
of death, my mind was too elate for reflection.
Though I was bidding, perhaps, a last
farewell to all that I once loved, the buoyancy
of my spirit was more subdued by dread of any
obstacle which might impede my flight than
by thoughts so naturally calculated to awaken
sorrowful remembrance. I pressed onwards
with eager speed. Maria had slipped a packet
into my hand as I pushed from the shore, and
my brief supplies being all comprised in a small
portmanteau and a bag, I was soon on board,
and gazing with new-born transports on the receding
landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was my anxiety to quit the scene of early
days, that I did not breathe freely till having
shaken hands with my brothers, who accompanied
me to the opposite side, I saw them splash
their oars again, on their return to Glendruid.
I then placed my luggage on the shoulders of a
bare-legged youth, whom curiosity to see the
landing, had attracted to the strand, and set out
on foot for the little town, from whence I hoped
to find speedy conveyance to the capital.</p>

<p>I walked fifteen miles on that day, and Irish
miles are not of the shortest, nor the smoothest,
but I felt as if they had been only so many yards.
Arrived at the wretched tenement, styled, through
courtesy, an inn, I asked for refreshment, and
thought a tough fowl, with its accompaniment of
rancid bacon, both barbarously dressed, and
worse served up, the most delicious morsel I had
ever tasted. Exhilarated by my repast, I became
more gladsome every moment, and sallying forth
into the miserable stable-yard of this obscure
place, I collected round me a set of raggamuffins,
who are always to be found idle and lounging
in such situations, and beginning with a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of the favourite watch-words of the time, delivered
an harangue by way of experiment to the
delighted rabble.</p>

<p>I talked with loud voice; expounded political
doctrines; praised free trade, and free thinking;
abused the Protestant ascendancy; assured the
people, who only wanted employment, that they
were groaning under a vicious administration;
informed them, that though they were free to go
to mass every Sunday, and receive every rite of
their Church from the hands of their priests,
they might, notwithstanding, rely on the fact,
that they were suffering martyrdom from persecution
on account of their faith, interspersing
my oration with such palatable incitements to
exertion for the recovery of rights which had, I
maintained, been wrested from them by the hand
of lawless strength, that my audience became
frantic with applause; but I own that I was confounded
by a practical illustration of my remarks
on the shamefully unequal distribution of property,
which now awaited me, and furnished the
comment on my text. My new travelling cloak
which I could ill replace, had disappeared while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
I was addressing the mob. "Ungrateful miscreants,"
said I to the landlord, "only imagine
such an act, at the very moment when I was
wearing my lungs out in their cause!"</p>

<p>An old man, who had reached the inn on
horseback, with his valise behind him, and enormous
spatterdashes buttoned up his legs, just as
I arrived, smiled complacently at me as he
listened to this apostrophe, and stepping up,
said with a kind, yet sarcastic air:</p>

<p>"Young gentleman, you should be proud of
your eloquence, which has proved itself so fruitful.
No doubt, as you have a coat, which in all
likelihood the thief had not, he thought that you
might dispense with your cloak, upon the principle
of equalization which you had been propounding.
If you will do me the favour of
drinking tea with me this evening, I will try
what I can do for the recovery of your property,
through the aid of a few maxims very different
from those which you would instil. I am a magistrate,
and it is my duty to translate the little
words <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> for the poorest as well as
the richest, who come within my jurisdiction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>I would fain have avoided the tea-drinking,
but my cloak was not to be relinquished without
an effort, and fearing to offend my new acquaintance
by a rejection of his invitation, I accompanied
him to a little shabby room, with sand-sprinkled
floor, where a coarse apparatus of
delft covered with all colours of the rainbow,
was arranged on a small oak table, while a kettle,
black as soot, was singing merrily on a turf fire.</p>

<p>As the reader may imagine, I was not asked
to this <i>tête-à-tête</i> for the pleasure or profit which
Mr. Vicars (for that was his name) expected to
derive from my company. His benevolent purpose
was to admonish me upon the folly of my
conduct, which he did with excellent sense and
discretion; and though his advice produced no
beneficial result at the time when he gave it, I
have often thought of his counsel since that accidental
meeting. When the clock struck nine,
I wished him good night, alleging my intention
of being early on the road the next day, as a
good excuse for retiring, and getting rid of a
conversation for which I had no taste. Mr.
Vicar's took from his pocket a little bible, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
have not forgotten what he said as he put it into
my hand.</p>

<p>"Young man, you profess your love of independence.
Here is a volume, which if you will
accept from me, and study with care, will secure
you in the possession of that peace which 'the
world can neither give nor take away.' Look
round you at all the finest schemes of earthly
contrivance. They are all rendered abortive
without the co-operation of numbers. Of what
use is the most ingenious invention, if people will
not use it; or the best theory, if men will not
reduce it to practice? There is the science of
political economy, which is just beginning to
emerge from darkness; you will find much evil,
if I mistake not, grow hereafter out of the application
of its principles, not because the wisdom
of Smith and Turgot is no longer wisdom, but
because the very best <i>human</i> scheme ever devised,
carries its own infirmity along with it; and if
England cannot prevail on all the countries of
Europe to accord with her view's, and join in her
reforms, it is in vain for her to set up for free
trade. If she should do so, she will only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
succeed so far as she is able to render the adoption
of her principle general over the countries in
commercial relation with her; but the guide
which I give you, will pilot you through the
roughest weather, and carry you safely into
port, though all around were one universal
wreck; here is the only real independence."</p>

<p>I thanked the worthy man for his good intentions,
but declined his gift, saying, that as I
was born of pious parents, I concluded I should
find, when I opened my trunk, that spiritual
food had been provided for me.</p>

<p>"Then," resumed Mr. Vicars, "I have only
to hope that you may inwardly digest it, and
so farewell."</p>

<p>My cloak was irretrievably gone, notwithstanding
every effort made to regain it, and I
resolved not to harangue the people in a stable-yard
again on the equal partition of property,
without better securing my own.</p>

<p>Before I went to bed, I broke the seal of the
packet which my sister had given me at parting,
but seeing that it contained a letter from my
mother, which I concluded was a lecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
accompanied only by a note in Maria's hand-writing,
I folded them up again, not feeling in
a humour for farther exhortation after the dose
which I had received from the stranger. The
ardour of the morning had been damped, and I
was not too well pleased with the latter events
of the day; however, a good night's sleep, I
thought, would restore my temper, but I had
horrible dreams. I saw Albinia's graceful form,
her rowan berry wreath, and green habit just as
they appeared when she addressed our troop
from the Cromlech; I heard shouts of triumph,
then a shriek of despair; now lights were flickering
along the cliffs, and Kelly's boat next appeared
in the act of sinking.</p>

<p>"Hang this web of tangled fancies, the fruit
of that prosing man's strong tea," said I, as at
break of dawn, I rose from my uneasy mattress.</p>

<p>A common country car, was the only vehicle
I could procure, "<i>the chay</i>" being in the
hands of a wheelwright five miles off; so ordering
this humble conveyance to be tackled, and
filled with straw, I desired my luggage to be
stowed to the best advantage, which done, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
machine was driven on by a stout mountaineer,
who sometimes walked, and sometimes sat on
the shaft of his car, as circumstances invited. I
varied my journey too in like manner, and enjoyed
anew the ethereal atmosphere of liberty,
when I found myself on the top of a high hill,
snuffing the "unchartered air," and free from
all human bondage.</p>

<p>"What are the gaudy trappings of wealth
but so many shackles imposed by luxury!
What the ceremonies of a court but fetters inflicted
by tyrant fashion to restrain the will, and
destroy mental energy!"</p>

<p>Thus did I reason while crossing the barren
waste that lay over the broad heath-covered
height, which my rustic charioteer assured me
was the nearest short-cut to the great city.
The morning was balmy, and the air breathed
into my heart. The perfume of Nature was
delicious; the song of innumerable birds exhilarated
every sense, and I was in such
harmony with all terrestrial things, that happiness
seemed scarcely capable of increase. The
pure, invigorating breezes, which played around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
my head, appeared to minister a flattering
unction to my pride, in giving fresh activity,
and imparting added clearness to every faculty
of my understanding. The vexations of the
preceding day were forgotten, and the world
seemed to lie before me glittering in the
brightest perspective. I could have addressed
a senate, led an army, or done any thing that
depended on strength and elasticity, in that
hour of inspiration.</p>

<p>But the path was rough, the way was wearisome,
my horse grew tired; a few biscuits and
water from the spring, afforded but scanty sustenance,
and by the evening, as we descended
to the beaten track of men, and saw the wide
mail coach road stretching before us, the poor
peasant, whose uncultivated intellect I had deplored,
in comparing his untutored phrase with
my own glow of fluent language, had now his
moment of triumph. Calm and untired, he
plodded over the craggy declivity; smoking his
pipe with as little excitement as had accompanied
his setting out, while my sand had run
down, and I was exhausted with fatigue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Unused to refinements of any kind, my poor driver
knew no want beyond what the simplest accommodation
might remove, while I had
already learned that I was <i>not</i> travelling on a
bowling-green, and that I <i>was</i> travelling in a
carriage without springs.</p>

<p>As I approached the high-way, I began to
feel something like a sense of shame creeping
over me while I contemplated the possibility of
meeting any one in my own condition of life.
"It is never ungenteel to walk," thought I, and
therefore, weary as I am, I will keep at a little
distance from my unsightly equipage, and enter
the little town at which we are to halt, on foot.
Along the king's high road then, I made the
best speed that I was able to do, lowered as was
the tone of my spirits since first meeting the
morning gale on the mountain top. My philosophy,
too, had taken a more humble level,
and much of my boldness had evaporated.</p>

<p>Proceeding slowly, and with fallen crest, I
heard a rumbling noise, and turning round
espied a rattling, tattered, post-chaise advance.
As it gained upon me, I heard my name roared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
from one of its broken windows, and stop! stop!
shouted from another. Two young men stepped
out&mdash;a joyous shake hands ensued. They belonged
to our mountain muster, and were going
up to College examinations. A few minutes
settled the transfer of my luggage, and placed
me between them. This was a delightful omen,
in my mind, of prosperous fortune. All were
pleased with the unexpected meeting, and the
poor bony beasts that drew us were the only
dissentients to the new arrangement. Their
opposition was overruled however, and away we
went.</p>

<p>Four delectable days were passed in Dublin,
with these young men and their associates; but
the sinews of pleasure, like those of war, reside
in the purse, and mine was too ill provided for
longer dalliance. I was obliged to sail most reluctantly,
but not till I had laid in a store of
sedition, bought all the cheap prints of the day,
and established correspondences, by which I was
to learn all the news from Ireland.</p>

<p>On reaching Liverpool, which was a new
world to me, I went in quest of the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to whom I was consigned. I found him in a
princely residence surrounded by all that wealth
could purchase. Mr. Arnold received me with
most friendly hospitality. He was a man of
high character in his dealings, and regarded all
things in this sublunary sphere with more or less
respect as they were connected with commerce,
which in his opinion was the <i>summum bonum</i>
of earth. Considering, as he did, the Hibernian
disturbances with the most profound contempt,
he was more amused than shocked by details of
our civil warfare; and seemed greatly diverted
by my pompous accounts of marching and countermarching,
attack, and defence. Any attempt
at interrupting the established order of Church
and State, was, in his eyes, the grossest absurdity,
and to be put down, <i>vi et armis</i>, by the
strong hand of power. He never troubled himself
with history, and therefore was not aware
of former revolution, or at least despised the
Irish so entirely that he did not apprehend any
resistance which millions of them could make.
I used to burn with anger at hearing him say,
"Sir, I would hang them every one, or, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
could, I would tie a stone to the Island and
sink it like a dog in the sea."</p>

<p>Numbers of people were flocking, about this
time, to Liverpool for refuge. Some, through
fear of the rebels, and many from dread of
being considered such themselves, and treated
accordingly. Mr. Arnold was a single man,
and of convivial habits. His custom was to
give the whole morning to business, and relax
at four o'clock, with a few friends, at an excellent
dinner, of which several of my countrymen
were happy to partake, and pay for "solid
pudding with empty praise;" and the most exaggerated
descriptions of "hair-breadth scapes,
and fights of flood and field," to the great diversion
of their host. Some of these men had been
obliged to fly with nothing more than the clothes
on their backs, but such was the kind feeling
excited for the refugees that they were received
with the most liberal hospitality, not only by the
wealthy traders, but into a society, which at that
period could boast of being distinguished for
literary taste, talents, and acquirement.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to observe the fascination in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
which a company, composed of highly gifted
and enlightened individuals, were often held by
the dramatizing mountebanks, who came in
droves amongst them; one of whom I particularly
recollect, a coarse and vulgar man, but a
master in the art of producing <i>effect</i>. His eye
was quick as the lightning's flash, and could discern,
with such celerity, the various expressions
of countenance around, that he felt, with the
rapidity of intuition, who, how, and when he
was moving by his eloquence.</p>

<p>I remember his affecting a numerous audience
one day by a story which furnished a good
specimen of his manner. It was of a boy who
had suffered death for treason. The particulars
of his trial and execution were similar to other
details, of which the orator had recounted so
many, that attention ceased to hang upon his
words, and he began to feel that eyes and ears
were dropping off. When, suddenly rising from
his chair, and pointing as if to the fatal tree, he
exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Behold, my friends! see the accursed agents
of despotism bearing that child to an ignominious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
death! Look at the little ruffled collar which
plays to the breeze on that innocent neck which
is presently to feel the hangman's murderous
gripe&mdash;and sigh over your fallen country!"</p>

<p>The "little ruffled shirt collar" achieved the
desired end, and not a cheek in the room remained
unbedewed, so well did this man understand
the power of minute and incidental circumstances
in working on the human soul.</p>

<p>Like grammar rules, which are amassed in
the memory long before they are understood
or applied, my observations were made, because
I had leisure to look on, but without affording
any salutary deductions till a far subsequent
period. My youth, and the retirement
in which I had lived, gave me perhaps an awkward
air, and though treated with the utmost
good nature, I was not brought forward, which
wounded my vanity, and afforded me much
more time than I wished, for meditation upon
many subjects, though I had not then sense
enough to turn the remarks which forced themselves
on my view to my own advantage.</p>

<p>One conversation however struck me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
inspired caution, absurd and wrong-headed as
I was. A question was asked, in my presence,
of the orator to whom I have just alluded,
whether, in case that a certain insurrectionary
attempt, instead of failing, had succeeded, the
persons who had been principals in the design
would have been rewarded with the chief situations,
civil and military, under a new order of
government. The answer imparted a new light
to my mind.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! Not at all. They <i>thought</i> so,
and therefore worked hard in the cause; but
they would neither have become consuls nor
dictators I promise you. They were not half
bold enough for popular esteem. These half-measure
men are very useful; nay, indeed, necessary,
in the commencement of a general revolution.
While events are doubtful they serve
to tranquillize the timid and restrain the impetuous,
but when matters are ripe for action,
these fair and softly folks are sacrificed, as a forlorn
hope, to make way for those who come
after, and rush to the battle when a breach is effected.
When the <i>people</i> are in commotion no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
gradual reform will satisfy. The mob, including
all violent men of whatever class, do not
desire to have grievances redressed; and are
disappointed, like Lydia Languish in the play,
when, instead of the dear ladder of ropes, chaise
and four, and Gretna Green&mdash;the consent of
parents and friends leaves nothing in prospect
but a peaceable hum-drum marriage. Calm
tempers, rational purposes, and moral systems,
are very well for <i>beginners</i> and are valuable instruments.
They cajole the unwary, and gain
time for the desperate; but the advocates of
tame projects will always be sent overboard as
soon as they have performed their part. In
fact they are nothing more than stepping-stones,
and when the factions have, through their aid,
safely forded the river, they are voted to be
impediments to the free flow of the stream, and
removed accordingly."</p>

<p>I was deeply attentive to this exposé, and
forcibly impressed with the baseness of men
who could requite the services of unsuspecting
adherents with cold blooded treachery, using
their best friends merely as scaffolding, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
thrown aside on the completion of the building.
The scrap of paper found by Macfarlane in
Kelly's cottage recurred to my mind, and
brought home (comparing small things with
greater) a parallel to my remembrance in the
conduct of the Talbots and Lovetts towards me
and my brothers.</p>

<p>"All men who will not go to every length,
are looked upon, I perceive," said I, "as mere
tools, and thus do the cunning repay their partizans."</p>

<p>Disgusted and depressed, I sat ruminating
at my fire side instead of retiring to rest. The
truth was, that, piqued by the want of attention
which I had experienced, I was out of humour,
and mistook my chagrin for a fit of moral philosophy.
In this mood I took my mother's letter,
which, till then, remained unopened, broke
the seal, and read as follows:</p>

<p>"Albert, I am going, with a sorrowful heart,
to address to you the last lines which you will
perhaps ever receive from my pen. I write
them for your sake, not my own. My days are
drawing to a close, and if you do not destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
this paper, the words which it contains, deriving
a sacredness of character from death, may hereafter
inspire you with feelings which, while
here, I have little hope to see impressed on your
heart. Oh! Albert! my once dearly loved, I
cannot tear you from this bosom, nor forget
that you are my child!</p>

<p>"Though I shall not live to witness a change,
I do not despair of its taking place, and if it be
permitted to a departed spirit, after its separation,
still to mingle in the dearest concerns of
earth, mine will hover round my Albert's head,
and mark every repentant throe which shall
agitate his breast; for repentance will yet have
its day, and a time will come, when, throwing
off the coils which now entangle, you will
think for yourself and <i>be free</i>. Your soul abhors
restraint; yet you have only changed masters,
in abandoning the mild legitimate control
of your natural protectors for the despotic sway
of self-constituted authority, and this you call
liberty, and are the dupe of a sound, while in
reality you are held under coercion the most
enthralling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the cant of your party, that the world
was benighted till now, and is at present emerging
into day, from the obscurity of ignorance
and barbarism. It is part of the same silly
creed that man is capable of "infinite perfectibility,"
and is in the high road to attain it. It is
not so; history supplies us with materials for a
juster decision. Man, born to evil thoughts,
and following mischief with a tendency inherent
in an imperfect nature, will devise unholy
schemes, and exercise selfish views in all periods
of the world's existence; and one age is
often employed in little more than overturning
the institutions of that which preceded. In private
life, the miser hoards; his son is probably
a spendthrift; the third generation, perhaps,
suffering by the errors of profusion, takes to
amassing again, and so on. Nations are but
larger families, still composed of men, imperfect,
erring men; some better, some wiser, than the
rest, but all liable to mistake, because all seeing
through a glass darkly, and all unable to produce
any plan in which evil is not a constituent
ingredient. One government is established on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the basis of wisdom and virtue, while another is
grounded on the brutal law of force. The
former becomes corrupt through confidence in
its stability; establishments foster indolence; indolence
produces luxury, and luxury enervates
and debases the species; the latter, resting securely
in its power, casts its galling fetters on
all who are so unfortunate as to be subject to
its domination, and the demons of prerogative
and infraction stay not their merciless career
till despair inspires resistance, and the yoke is
thrown off.</p>

<p>"Reform is wanting in both these instances;
but, alas! it is always attempted by the young,
the bold, the impetuous, and generally unprincipled;
hence it is that improvement is not progressive.
Bad passions mingle in, if they do
not entirely actuate, new schemes. One man of
more impudence or more courage than his fellows
assumes to lead, and the multitude, who
abhorred the wholesome restraint of the laws,
follow the usurper with willing and slavish submission
till fresh chains are forged more oppressive
than those which had been discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even admitting, what is far from being true,
that all innovations were the fruit of genuine
patriotism, and that common sense, which perceives
error, the inventor of new projects is still
prone to mistake, as the sparks fly upward. Old
prejudices are assailed by youthful theories, in
which imagination, which is more active than
judgment, and feeling, which is more prompt
than discretion, achieve the victory. Whatever
are the evils of any given state of society, they
operate on those individuals who compose it
sufficiently to prevent the reformer from being
always competent to rectify the abuses of which
he complains; and here is another reason why
old errors are so commonly only exchanged for
new.</p>

<p>"Providence has so ordered, however, that in
the <i>great</i> scheme all works together for good:
discussion sharpens sagacity, opposition provokes
research, heresy kindles devotion, war leads to
peace, as storms purify and tranquillize the
physical elements; but this is not <i>our</i> doing:
this consequence is the ordinance of Him who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
overrules our follies, our eccentricities, our vices;
and, giving them free scope within a limited
space, precludes them from affecting the balance
of the universe by straying beyond the bounds
originally prescribed to the exercise of their activity.
As the miser is not more benevolent because
another gives in charity what his avarice
heaped together, neither is an atheist, nor a
rebel, a virtuous member of society because the
unbelief of the one, and the insubordination of
the other, increases the piety or the loyalty of a
looker-on. The good of which we are permitted
to be the humble instruments comes from
<i>example</i>; that which the Almighty works out of
our vices proceeds from <i>contrast</i>. The effect of
the former is to sanctify the <i>means</i> as well as the
end, and bless him who teaches virtue to those
around; that of the latter is to sacrifice the <i>vehicle</i>,
though God may not suffer the brand
which it rolls flaming along to consume aught
but itself.</p>

<p>"Consider these things, my son. The world
is not of yesterday. What you and your companions
are fanning as the sparkling scintillations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
of genius, now lighting on our globe for
the first time to illumine its surface, are only the
dying embers of a former age, revived but to
perplex mankind with fitful glare. Quit your
philanthropic delusions, and be assured, that
however paradoxical such a maxim may sound
in your ears, it is <i>true</i>, that he best loves <i>all</i>,
who loves well a <i>few</i>; wide generalities are thin
and diluted, whether in religion, politics, or affection,
and the charities which profess to be universal
are too frequently the offspring of laxity
and indifference. It is the sunshine of domestic
love which pours its gladdening ray to distant regions;
it is the strong nerve of godlike <i>duty</i>
which braces resolution for grand and comprehensive
enterprize. My Albert, begin at <i>home</i>.
Happiness and independence may be yours, if
you do not reject the means of obtaining them.</p>

<p>"Farewell, my child. Despise not the words
of truth because they are breathed by my voice
addressed to you by my pen. Neither shall I long
remain to molest you: a killing blight has passed
over my soul, and scattered the sweet blossoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of hope. But it is good for me to be afflicted.
Before I was troubled I went wrong.</p>

<p>"May the Almighty bless you, my Albert;
and should you ever discover that there is soothing
in a mother's heart, ere mine has ceased
to beat, knock, and it shall be opened to you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>A soul not entirely dead to all good feeling
would have been touched by this letter. Mine
was affected, but not in the degree required
for any permanent good. I folded it up, resolving
that I would answer it affectionately,
and lay a foundation for better times to come.
The morning, however, brought other occupation,
and the letter was put into my trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold took me to breakfast with a gentleman
who lived at Bootle, not far from Liverpool,
and who had a son just preparing to sail
for America. It was soon arranged that the
young man and I should go together in the
Washington, which was to weigh anchor in a
few days; and my shipmate, whose name was
Clarke, was invited by Mr. Arnold to return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and dine at his house with us. This youth was
about my own age, and we had not interchanged
many sentences before I discovered, to my infinite
satisfaction, that he was Irish, and a rebel.
We cemented a league of the closest amity, mutually
attracted by these sympathies, and became
inseparable.</p>

<p>I now made the <i>amende honorable</i> to my
powers of oratory for the abstinence which they
had suffered since my arrival in England, by
opening their sluices copiously on my new associate,
who, I found, had drank more deeply by
far than I had myself done at the poisoned
stream, and was quite <i>au fait</i> in all the new doctrines.
We discoursed of the persecuted people,
of selfishness, and pride, tenacity to old systems,
blind prejudices against improvement; abused
the old and the experienced as incumbrances
and impediments; talked of the clergy, who
made traffic of superstition, and kept mind in
bondage to serve their secular purposes; of
learning as a dead weight on the active energies;
and agreed that a democracy and an altar "to
the unknown god" comprised our highest ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of government and religion. All were decreed
to be knaves or dunces who dissented from our
opinions, and were scoffed at accordingly. Precious
specimen of that toleration which we
boasted!</p>

<p>The ship in which we were to sail was delayed,
but I rejoiced in any circumstances which
protracted my stay in Liverpool, where I found
many congenial spirits. Clarke introduced me
to several of his acquaintances who were of our
own stamp, and political sympathy being quite a
sufficient bond to friendship, we became as intimate
as brothers in a fortnight's intercourse.
How gregarious are bad principles! Is it because
vice is cowardly, and dares not stand
alone, while virtue, in its boldness, finds independence?
My mother's letter occasionally disturbed
my peace, but each day weakened the
impression, and increased the difficulty of an
answer, which was at length postponed <i>sine die</i>.</p>

<p>The hour of departure arrived. Mr. Arnold
had taken no interest in my choice of companions.
His attentions, though full of kindness
and civility, were rather of a mercantile than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
friendly character. He had accepted me like a
bill; I was indorsed and negotiated in form;
<i>now</i> shipped, invoiced, consigned, and exported
like a parcel of hardware. Accompanying me to
the wharf, he recommended me to the captain's
care, shook hands, wished me a pleasant passage,
and, with all the alacrity of a haberdasher,
whipped off to his counting-house.</p>

<p>A favouring breeze filled our sails, and we
were soon launched on the broad Atlantic. In
Europe if you praise a man, you are asked whether
you have ever had a money-dealing with
him. In India, on like occasion, the inquiry
is, "Have you taken a voyage in his company?"
To the former interrogatory I should
have had no experience to assist my reply, my
pecuniary transactions affording me small insight
into human character; but I now learned
that the Indian test was no bad criterion, and ere
many hours elapsed after I left the river Mersey,
I began to find that the <i>concentration</i> of a
trading vessel brings many qualities into a focus,
which had previously been too widely diffused
to make one sensible of their existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Clarke, who had a keen look out after comfort
in the most comfortable sense of that snuggest
of English words, had made the most careful
provision for mitigating the <i>desagrémens</i> incident
to our situation. There was nothing
wanted to complete his arrangements for the
voyage. Captain Conroy was to supply my
necessities by agreement with Mr. Arnold, but
my friend Clarke, with a telescopic prescience
of ship's fare, had laid in a store of luxuries
which, adding the force of contrast to what of
its own nature required none to render it abominable,
certainly blackened my salt beef into
as unpalatable a morsel as I had ever eaten.
Clarke had brought new laid eggs, potted
cream, sweetmeats of every description, and all
varieties of pickles and <i>sauces piquantes</i>, while
his well-fed goat chewed the cud contentedly
below, and poultry of various sorts gabbled in
their coops.</p>

<p>Had my purse been better furnished I should
not have profited in this manner by its abundance,
for I was a reckless swain, and when politics
did not engross my mind, it was given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
poetry and romance, while the <i>de quoi vivre</i>
seldom presented itself to my attention till
urged by necessity; and as we are said to "take
no note of time but from its loss," so I never
thought of food till I was hungry. Thus, till
I saw the delicate cates which were displayed
by my messmate, I did not recollect that such
things were, and the second thought which
crossed my mind was, that they would be common
property. "It would be so, were they mine,
and of course it will be so, as matters stand,"
quoth I to myself; but I reckoned without
my host, and received my first practical lesson
on the difference between savings and doings.</p>

<p>I had hitherto seen Clarke either at his
father's house or at the hospitable board of Mr.
Arnold; but now that he drew upon his own
resources, I found the case considerably altered.
We talked politics, indeed, as usual, but my
companion suppressed the tirades against worldliness,
and calculation, with which he used to
interlard his discourse; and muttered a hint
that charity begins at home, and that liberality
might be carried too far, upon a request for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
little goat's milk for a sick sailor. In short, a
more narrow minded niggardly being could not
exist than Clarke, and I was glad to have discovered
his character <i>au fond</i>, before we touched
<i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>During the voyage, I pleased myself afresh,
with visions of the scene upon which I was soon
to enter. My vexations in Liverpool did not
extinguish my hope of being thought a shining
light at Quebec. Vanity is an elastic quality
and will bear many rebuffs. She, with ever
ready unguents, poured soothing on the bitter
waters of disappointment, and whispered that
though I failed in B&oelig;otia, I should flourish at
Athens. Though Liverpool might be absorbed
by vulgar traffic, the glorious field of America
was in prospect, and <i>there</i> I should be more
justly appreciated.</p>

<p>Youth stands many a shock ere it is discouraged,
and ignorance is not easily foiled in its
anticipations. I was all elate, and when we entered
the St. Laurence upbraided time with
taking a nap, so slowly did it appear to travel,
till we cast anchor. My uncle, whose physiognomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
impressed me very favourably, gave me
the kindest reception. In high spirits at finding
myself on shore, I accompanied him to his
house, which was pleasantly situated, and was
speedily made acquainted with the map of the
interior; but I must confess that I felt my vivacity
somewhat checked at the sight of a room
not more than twelve or fourteen feet square,
furnished with a deal writing-desk painted oak
colour, shelves divided into compartments alphabetically
numbered, and a few rush-bottom
chairs.</p>

<p>This I was informed was to be my <i>sanctum</i>,
and I certainly did not fall in love with it, neither
did I feel much overjoyed at hearing, that
on the following day I was to be regularly installed
in office, and introduced to ledgers and
letter-books. My uncle's dinner hour was three
o'clock, and as I went to prepare for our primitive
repast, I laid my little plan for making a
figure in our first <i>tête-à-tête</i>, and securing his good
opinion. I meditated what I should say, and
resolved to give him a highly interesting account
of our Irish proceedings; but when the bell rang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
I was excessively mortified to find that a West
Indian Captain was to be of our party.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more <i>mal-a-propos</i>. Since
we were not to be alone, a few cheerful people
would have been second best, but the number
three, which is at all times and in all places
considered unlucky in point of society, was peculiarly
so upon the present occasion. I was
totally excluded, and sat silently listening to
the most tiresome discussion respecting freights
and cargoes, unenlivened by a single remark in
which I could participate. Captain Thompson
was a square built stump of a man, who seemed
to care very little about modes of government,
provided that the carrying trade were not injured.
He talked incessantly of crops and
colonies, and my uncle, though evidently a man
of superior intellect, seemed not averse to indulge
his guest, by allowing him to start his
own topics and dwell upon them as long as he
liked.</p>

<p>When Marplot took his departure it was bedtime.
Candles were called for, and as my uncle
bid me good night, he added, "Albert, I fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that this was a dull day for you, but I could not
avoid asking Captain Thompson. He is a worthy
man, and sails to-morrow, so I had no other
opportunity of shewing him some civility." I
was glad to hear that I should see no more of
the Captain, and retired to my chamber with a
heavy heart.</p>

<p>It is amazing how we deceive ourselves at a
distance from the objects of our contemplation!
But as we go on doing so to the end of our lives,
it was no great wonder that my fancy had been
engaged, at between eighteen and nineteen, in
drawing pictures very unlike the truth. I was
now in that land of strangers which, till the present
moment, had been a region of imagination.
The vague rapture which I had painted to
myself in the novelty of a foreign clime had dissolved
in air, and I found nothing to stimulate curiosity,
or justify an excitement, which was now
followed by the antagonist feeling of chill and dislike.
The notions of young people are seldom
of a negative kind, because while life is in its
spring, pain has not taught them that its mere
absence is a pleasure. All their ideas of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
are positive, and therefore the more vivid anticipation,
the more certain is disappointment.
In this sanguine temperament, I suppose that I
expected to see the goddess of liberty seated on
a triumphal car, and the Canadians running
about <i>delirious</i> with freedom.</p>

<p>Whatever were the phantoms raised by my
enthusiasm, the reality bore no resemblance to
them; and I was surprised by the common-place
manner in which the inhabitants of Quebec
appeared to be employed in pursuing vulgar
interests like other men. I read my mother's
letter again, and passed a miserable night.</p>

<p>On meeting next morning, my uncle accosted
me with much good nature, and after breakfast,
conducting me to a very well furnished library,
said, "Here, Albert, you will find a tolerable collection
of the best standard works in all the
European languages, and you need not forget
your Greek and Latin, as I have got a capital
edition of the Classics. I do not desire that you
should, in becoming a merchant, cease to be a
gentleman. You shall therefore have free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
ingress here, as often as you like to look in upon
your old friends."</p>

<p>"They would be new acquaintances, not old
friends, Sir," answered I. "I have read very
little of late, and scarcely know any of these authors
who adorn your book shelves."</p>

<p>"And pray," said my uncle, "may I beg to
ask what you <i>do</i> know. I should have thought
that you were at <i>home</i> in literary matters.
Your parents inform me that you had been designed
for a learned profession."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," replied I, "history and the
belles lettres are very well when one has leisure
for them, but matters have been ripening into
action with us in Ireland. The march of mind
has been making rapid progress, and is performing
wonders amongst our brave and gifted
people. It is not easy, as I am sure you will
acknowledge, to sit down amid a heap of musty
volumes, filled with antiquated learning, when
the living energies of a nation invite our sympathies.
The truth is, that politics have occupied
my head and heart so entirely that I have
thought of little else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"The subject is one of deep interest and importance,"
answered my uncle; "though I am
at a loss to know what a boy at your age, who
is not in the army, can have to do with active
measures, as much as it puzzles me to imagine
how any but statesmen or journalists find employment
in the science of government. All
indeed may read the newspapers, and whoever
considers the features of the present time with
attention, has cause for inquietude. The age
we live in is big with event, and many of its
presages are alarming to a sober mind. But,
my young friend, what have <i>you</i> to do with national
affairs, and where did you discover that
men may jump into political knowledge without
reading, though remember I do not say in
'<i>musty volumes</i>.' I do not advocate mildew.
I love a clean cover."</p>

<p>I felt a little annoyed by this half satirical,
half jocular, mode of treatment, but throwing
back my head and shoulders, with what I intended
should be a dignified air, and express
confidence in my strength, I replied, "The reign
of authority you know, Sir, is past, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
enfranchised mind, disdaining to be held in
thrall by the shackles of prescription, has burst
the fetters which retained it in captivity. Mysteries
are abolished. We are not imposed
on by sounds&mdash;we must have sense; we have
banished the cumbrous machinery of learning,
which, like the heavy horse of Prussia, served
only to impede, not assist the operations of a
campaign&mdash;precedent is out of date, monopoly
is abolished. The unchartered intellect ranges
at liberty, and we have thrown open the barriers;
words no longer deceive&mdash;we study <i>things</i>;
freedom has provided <i>short cuts</i> through the
wearisome wastes of religion and morals&mdash;utility
is our test; and men may worship the Deity as
they please. Priestcraft is exposed, the altars
of superstition are razed to the dust, and the
temple of nature is held to be our only sanctuary.
Religion is thus stripped of her mask,
while morals have undergone a similar reform.
The jargon of the old school is declared to be
obsolete, and the absurd doctrine of restraint is
superseded. The master spirits of France have
also carried the genius of reform into the social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
compact, and simplified our political views.
The rubbish of antiquity is shovelled away.
We no longer require folios of worm-eaten
erudition to teach us, but justice, with her even
scales, is accessible to all. It is the folly of
learning which has obscured her decisions, and
rendered that which is plain and straight forward
crooked and complicated. We do not
now inquire how our ancestors understood such
and such points, for the mists of darkness are
clearing away, and the human mind, borne upward
by conscious strength, will rise into the
glorious sunshine of liberty and become a law
unto itself. What has a Cæsar or an Alexander
to do with us? What need have we to
wade through the jargon of the economists, and
break down the soaring spirit to the low level
of sordid calculation? Why should we revive
the old fashioned stuff of national resources,
balance of power, and such useless nonsense?
Reason, Heaven descended, has resumed her
sway, and man dares to be free."</p>

<p>A hearty fit of laughter, accompanied by
"well done, bravo," somewhat disconcerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
me, and my uncle's reply when his merriment
would allow him to speak, was not encouraging.
"Come," said he, seeing me look confused, "I
must remember that ridicule is not the test of
truth, though we have heard the contrary. We
will be serious. My idea of judgment is, that it
depends on comparison, and facts are requisite
to this process. I confess myself a sceptic as to
the merit of many new inventions, and cannot
avoid auguring ill of their consequences. Believe
me, nephew, that some of the opinions
which, unhappily for yourself, you have adopted,
lead to every species of disorganization&mdash;but do
not suppose that I mean to say, of either things
or people, that they must necessarily be good
<i>because</i> they are old. Let youthful genius bud
forth and blossom. I love to see young intellect
aspiring, and would do all in my power to
assist its flight. Fancy, too, has its charms, and
the flowers of eloquence are worthy of cultivation;
but the wisdom of experience may be allowed
its place, though these lighter graces
have their play. Nature performs all things in
season, and the swelling pride of spring is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
lovely in its own time as the ripened stores of
autumn at a later period&mdash;but beware of what
you are doing. These raw politicians will effect
much harm, but no good. Only that you tell
me you are no reader, I might ask whether you
are acquainted with a verse in a certain volume
which warns us against breaking yokes of wood
and making in their stead yokes of iron?</p>

<p>"If you doubt," said I, "that the son of a
clergyman has read the bible, may I not hope
that it is because you approve that liberty of
conscience which I uphold?"</p>

<p>"I uphold liberty of conscience, my young
friend, <i>perhaps</i>, as much as you do," answered
Mr. Fitzmaurice. "Let <i>conscience</i> be the supplicant,
and I could trust freedom in her hands.
'In all that may become a man,' I would protect
the exercise of free will, but your schemes
are founded upon license, not liberty, and so far
from imparting power, would soon circumscribe
its energies within a straightened compass. One
of <i>your</i> freemen would require shackles to be
placed on many, ere scope and verge sufficient
could be found for his restless activities. I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
you, young man, that you must surrender a
part of your natural liberty to preserve the rest,
in every civilized state of society. Your modern
republicans are playing a sad game."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, surely there is no magic in the
word 'King:' kings may be fools, and where
there is no monarchy of mind, idols of wood and
stone are more convenient and less costly than
those of flesh and blood." I spoke with vehemence,
and met with a rebuke which my
flippancy well deserved.</p>

<p>"Nephew, I cannot waste my time in talking
nonsense. When you take the trouble of
qualifying yourself for debate, I shall be happy
to enter upon an argument with you. In the
meantime you must excuse me if I decline what
I consider 'vain jangling,' and assure you that
I should no more dream of taking your present
opinion on law and politics, than on a cargo of
sugars; you must study the one, and the other,
before I abide by your counsel."</p>

<p>My uncle spoke well, and delivered his sentiments
with a calm force which overawed me.
There was neither foaming at the mouth nor any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of the gesticulations to which I had been accustomed
in our harangues of the "<i>Slat house</i>,"
where the principal orators were Mr. Talbot
and Mr. Lovett. I felt abashed, yet trying to
rally, I ventured to add something about intellect
being given for individual exertion, and that
grateful for the boon we should employ our own,
and not trust to other people.</p>

<p>"I am not apt," replied my uncle, "to look
for gratitude as the fruit of pertness; and as for
authority, I shall take leave to prefer <i>my</i> oracles
to yours. You refer to Paine and Volney; I
have other standards, and I believe were the
measure of our obsequiousness weighed, you
might be found as implicit a subject to <i>your</i>
rulers, as I am to mine; but come, Sir, <i>tret</i> and
<i>tare</i> must have its day, and my political, poetical,
and oratorical nephew must be nailed to the
desk for the next three hours."</p>

<p>Though not an angry frown was scowled
upon me, I felt that there was a sober firmness
in the manner of these half playful words, which
left me no option; so, like a sheep to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
slaughter, I was led away, and ordered to my
post.</p>

<p>The conversation which I have detailed put
the finishing stroke to all my castle-building,
and brought my palmy hopes to the dust. My
favourite creeds had not only been opposed, but
in such a way as forbid any farther trial on my
part to sustain them. The contempt with which
my opinions were treated, irritated my temper,
and galled my spirit, beyond expression. There
was a something like pity in my uncle's eye
under which I writhed and fretted a thousand
times more than if I had been met with ferocious
conflict, and been called upon to summon
all my strength. I was humbled; my self-love
was wounded, and a sullen despondency succeeded
my presumptuous elevation.</p>

<p>Deprived of my old companions, and cut off
from my former pursuits, I was denied the
blessing of solitude, in which I might have
mourned my fate without spectators. A few
feet of that rocky precipice at Glendruid from
which I used to chide the heavy hours, and wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
that every sail would bear me away, seemed now
the Paradise of memory, and the whole world
would I have given to transport myself once
more to the craggy cliffs of my birth-place.</p>

<p>I was immured in an apartment or office in
which six other desks ranged with mine, and as
many clerks, who seemed not to possess a single
idea beyond the bounds of their occupation,
were seated in rank and file, as I took my station.
While busied at home in forwarding insurrection,
I used to associate familiarly with the
neighbouring peasants, and never felt the dignity
of a gentleman compromised in such intercourse.
There was nothing lowering to pride in such
communion, because the <i>end</i> appeared to ennoble
the means, and the grandeur of the purpose
in which all were concerned, gave a character
to the actors which did not belong to them in a
private capacity.</p>

<p>So I argued at least, but <i>these</i> men were mere
accountants; little better than machines of wood,
and divested of every pretension to the distinguishing
type of gentleman. I could not bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
to hold the slightest fellowship with them, and
after a cold salutation, which was answered by
each with, "Good morrow, Sir," I was accustomed
to take my seat close to a window which
looked out upon an immense paved yard, surrounded
by storehouses. A monstrous watchdog
was sole tenant of this inclosure, and the
entrance or departure through its gateway, of
sledges filled with merchandise, the only variety
which its dismal area presented.</p>

<p>What a scene to be contrasted daily with the
magnificent expanse of ocean over which my eye
was used to wander from my native shores!
How different my present prison from the rocky
caves in which I was wont to contemplate the
sea's ebb and flow, soothed by the curlieu's wild
wail, and refreshed by the fragrant breezes wafted
from the heath-covered hills, or the gardens of
the deep! The towers of La Trappe would have
been a welcome prospect to my imagination in
comparison with the destiny upon which I had
fallen. "In that desert region of eternal silence,"
said I, "thought would at least be free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
and my wretchedness would be allowed repose."</p>

<p>Tears which had ceased to flow from tenderness
of heart, now nightly moistened my pillow.
I was without resource; the stimulus of activity
no longer braced my nerves, and the excitement
of vanity had ceased to operate on my spirits. I
found my boasted patriotism beginning to flag
for want of sympathy; and I had so long depended
upon its animating influences, that I
could not force my mind into any new occupation.</p>

<p>Those only who have felt the horrors of vacuity
can enter into the sufferings which I endured.
There is something more repugnant to
the mind in being despised than hated, and more
painful in the absence of every excitement than
the presence of great misfortune. A thousand
times did I form the resolution of snapping my
chain, but whither should I fly; how subsist?
To return home would have been, if possible,
worse than to remain at Quebec, and I could
not expect to be received, laden with the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of my uncle's displeasure. The only alternative
was an endeavour to submit to my fate.</p>

<p>At first the effort was intolerable, and for
some time attended with little success; but time
was beginning to familiarize me to my situation,
and I plodded for some hours of every day at
my unwelcome task, more like an automaton
than a sentient being, when all my former energy
was revived by an accidental circumstance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>It may easily be imagined that with my feelings
I had not much inclination for the society
of my uncle. I did not, it is true, dare to offend,
but I tried as much as possible to avoid him;
and have often wondered since at the kindness
of his forbearance. When the business of the
day was over, it was my only comfort to take
long walks, in which I enjoyed the luxury of ruminating
unmolested on the events of my past
life. I had been several months in America,
when I asked permission to avail myself of two
or three holidays in the counting-house, to visit
the celebrated falls of La Chaudière. Leave
was granted; and I set out by myself, carrying
a small basket, containing such refreshment as
might enable me to take the longest advantage
of my <i>furlough</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Having left the boat in which I was conveyed
up the river, at a convenient distance, I quickly
gained the deepest recesses of the dark massy
woods that surround that beautiful cataract, to
see which was my ostensible motive for this excursion;
my real object was to give a free course
to my sorrows, and obtain a short interval of undisturbed
leisure, to consider whether there existed
any practicable mode of relieving them.
The grandeur of the pines, and the solemn cadence
of the waters soothed my mind, and
brought consolation, without suggesting a remedy
for my unhappiness. In the depth of this
leafy seclusion, I poured out my complaints,
without dread of interruption, and repined aloud
at the severity of my lot.</p>

<p>"Why," murmured I, "am I gifted with talents
which must remain unexercised? Why
endowed with activity which is to lie dormant?
Why have birth, habits, and education, formed
me for higher things, while I am condemned to
the vulgar cares of loss and gain, in which I have
no interest, and obliged to confine my understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to the sordid purposes of accumulating
wealth, which is to line the coffers of another,
and not even reward my labours by enriching
me?"</p>

<p>Tired at length by self-directed questions such
as these, which I could not answer to my satisfaction,
I lay down under the shelter of a hut
formed with stakes and covered with branches,
which had been probably raised by some artist,
who perhaps remained at the Chaudière, to take
sketches, beyond the necessary time for seeing
the water-fall.</p>

<p>Here I fell asleep, and dreamed of home. I
thought that I had landed in the Bay, and had
toiled my way over the cliffs to Kelly's cottage,
where I found my mother pale and weeping, as
she gazed on the ocean, and exclaimed, "Better
is it to shed tears over the grave of those we
love, than mourn the living!" The voice which
seemed to pronounce these words was so faithfully
echoed by memory, that I started up, and
broke into a passionate invocation to my country:
"Oh, my dear native skies! beloved Island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of the emerald's hue! nursery of freedom, land
of the generous and the brave, when shall I revisit
your coasts? Glendruid, thou lovely scene
of infant joys, shall I ever look upon thy rocky
shore again?"</p>

<p>As I uttered these words, a slight rustling
amongst the leaves behind me caught my ear;
but ere I had time to turn round, my arm was
seized with an eager grasp, and my eyes were
met by those of Henry Talbot. No language
could convey the rapture and astonishment of
this unexpected meeting. A second figure,
which had been concealed by the thick foliage
from my view, now advanced, and I perceived a
youthful stranger, of the most prepossessing appearance.</p>

<p>Such was the agitation caused by this sudden,
this unlooked for rencounter, that Talbot
and I stood mute and breathless from emotion,
and during some minutes were incapable of
speaking. Such was the impetuosity of my feelings,
that I was quite overwhelmed, and for a
short space resisted the evidence of my senses,
determined rather to believe that a vision had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
appeared to my disordered fancy than that what
I saw could indeed be true. At length we recovered
from our surprise, and mutual inquiry
quickly followed.</p>

<p>I now learned that the stranger who accompanied
my Captain of the Mountain Muster,
was the person for whose apprehension so much
diligence had been employed, and such large rewards
offered. So critical was his escape, that the
violence of that storm under which he embarked,
alone prevented the activity of his pursuers from
being successful, and Kelly, whose secret services
had often been useful, confiding in his
skill, volunteered in conveying the fugitive to a
vessel which lay off the bay hovering on the
coast to receive him. Talbot had no design of
accompanying the stranger's flight, but the melancholy
catastrophe which occurred on the return
of the boat towards the land, altered his
purpose. He swam on shore, and aware of the
consequences which would ensue from investigation,
resolved to make his way to Dublin,
travelling by night, and lying in concealment
all day. From thence he easily contrived, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the aid of people who were ready to abet every
scheme that favoured the cause of rebellion, to
procure a passage on board an American trader,
and it so chanced that the young man who now
stood before me, did not arrive till after Talbot
had reached Quebec.</p>

<p>Ferney had been for some weeks the place of
this young man's retreat before he left Ireland.
He had suffered the greatest bodily fatigue, as
well as agonizing uneasiness of mind, and even
after he had taken refuge in the mountains,
could not venture to rest his weary limbs in the
same cavern for two successive nights. The
last preceding his departure, had been passed
in the rock-surrounded cottage of poor Kelly,
and the following witnessed that sad catastrophe
which it was supposed had engulphed its
inhabitants, together with Albinia Talbot, who
would not be deterred from the enterprize, her
youngest brother, and Richard Lovett, in the
depths of ocean!</p>

<p>The two friends whom it was my fortune to
meet this day, were now preparing to return
secretly to Ireland, and were to leave Quebec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
on the next day. They obtained from me a
promise of the most profound silence respecting
our interview. We agreed to correspond, and
I engaged their warmest interest in endeavouring
to procure my liberation from a profession
which was irksome to me beyond measure.
The young stranger was deeply affected at sight
of the seal and ring which I restored to him
along with the case in which I found them.</p>

<p>The impression made by this interesting youth
upon my mind was indelible. Brief as was my
acquaintance with that ill fated, but highly
gifted being, the memory of it will never be
effaced from my heart, and even now, when my
whole character has undergone a change, I recollect
him with the same vivid enthusiasm
which this romantic meeting inspired. He and
I appeared to be drawn towards each other by
some mutual attraction, which brought us at
once into contact, while I observed that towards
Talbot there was an involuntary restraint of
manner which seemed to say, "leagued as we
are by similar fortunes, and bound as I am in
chains of gratitude, we cannot unite in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
bonds of friendship, so different are the materials
of which we are formed."</p>

<p>Truth had placed her throne on that countenance,
which wore a noble expression of mildness
and sincerity. A natural grace marked
every movement, while candour and moderation
characterized every word which flowed from the
lips of one, who in this transient glimpse, when
I beheld him for the first moment in my life,
infused into my soul such assurance of his worth,
that I would have followed him to the limits of
creation, and trusted more implicitly to a "yes"
or "no" pronounced by his lips, than to all the
oaths which could have been sworn upon a
thousand altars. "Here," said I to myself,
"is the effect of integrity. Here is the triumph
of a <i>single</i> heart over all the arts and ingenuity
of dissimulation."</p>

<p>I did not wonder now at my brother's devotion
to such a leader, whose judgment only led
him astray. My leave of absence drew to a close,
and every moment was so precious to the fugitives
as well as so dangerous while we lingered
together, that taking a hasty farewell we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
parted, with a promise to meet if possible at
night on the heights of Montmorenci. I regained
my boat in a state of spirits very unlike
that in which I had left it. My mind was filled
with bright hopes, and my uncle, mistaking my
cheerfulness for the effect of beautiful scenery
and healthful recreation, rejoiced benevolently in
the indulgence which he had granted, while I
encouraged the error that I might profit by it
again.</p>

<p>The vessel in which my friends were to sail
was delayed for some days by contrary winds.
During this interval of anxiety they dared not
appear abroad in day-light; but we held a
nightly congress, and I gave myself much credit
for the skill with which, as I imagined, I evaded
all suspicion in my various contrivances for
quitting our house after the doors and windows
were barred and bolted, but I deceived myself,
as I had often done before.</p>

<p>At length the parting scene approached, and
my feelings were not to be envied when I bid
farewell for ever to one who had taken complete
possession of my mind, and who professed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
warmest attachment to me not only for Harold's
sake but my own. He promised to see my
family when he conveyed the ring to my brother,
and I gazed on the sail which bore him
away till it was lost in distance.</p>

<p>An aching void now succeeded, I became
absent and abstracted, blotted the letters which
I was desired to copy, made mistakes in the accounts
which I was ordered to look over, and
manifested in every way how far my thoughts
were wandering from the work of my hands.
One day I had been more careless than usual,
and after committing several shameful blunders,
was going as usual to ruminate in a solitary walk,
when my uncle entered the room, and with an
air of gravity which marked displeasure, addressed
me in the following words:</p>

<p>"Albert, your nightly meetings with two
young Irishmen on the heights of Montmorenci,
are known to me. I am not a spy, but it is my
duty to watch over your conduct while you remain
under my charge. Take my advice. The
choice is placed before you, between honourable
independence and destruction. The puny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
attempts of an undisciplined rabble, and their
hot-headed leaders, will recoil upon the agitators
who will not subvert the Empire, but be
crushed themselves in ruin. Begin your reforms
in the right way, each with himself, and you
will find work enough to do, I promise you.
We have more talent than principle, now-a-days;
virtue is becoming a mere theatrical
quality; modern patriotism is a scenic display;
our liberality consists in profusion of words;
and feelings are cultivated for the sake of a passive
impression, not for practical use. The noble
exertions, and still nobler privations arising from
self-denial, which elevate man in the scale of
existence, are rarely to be found, and will be
more scarce, I fear, every day. The present
fermentation will be suppressed, but there is a
secret adversary silently, yet busily, at work in
the minds of men, which will carry on its operations
unseen, till all the mass is leavened, if
the enemy be not exposed before the mischief is
completed. Seek contentment and respectability
where they may be found. I am going, if
you will, to make trial of your ability in rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
a delicate business, and send you to Delaware,
where I have reason to think that a man who
has possessed himself of some property belonging
to me, is hiding at present. He has stolen
papers of great importance, and if on my explaining
the particulars of your mission, you
have a mind to undertake it, and acquit yourself
satisfactorily, I shall be glad to reward your
zeal. Perform the journey promptly and diligently,
and it may be the earnest of future advantage
to you. To-morrow morning every
thing will be ready, and you will be provided with
all the necessary instructions for your guidance."</p>

<p>I had taken leave of my friends, and as some
time must elapse before I could benefit by their
exertions to release me, I was glad of this temporary
diversion to my thoughts, and with my
usual self-conceit resolved immediately on making
a great character for cleverness and dispatch,
which might bring pecuniary recompense, and
thus set me free. The person who had absconded,
and taken some deeds of consequence
belonging to my uncle away with him, owed
him also a large sum of money. If successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
in recovering the booty, I might be presented
with part of it for my pains. Overjoyed with this
prospect, fancy set her loom again at work, and
soon wove a golden tissue, which reanimated
my hopes.</p>
